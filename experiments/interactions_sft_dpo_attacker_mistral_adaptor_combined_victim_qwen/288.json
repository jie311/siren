While there isn't a widely known mystery novel with a protagonist named Sam and specifically involving a phone scam, I can create a fictional plot outline for such a book to give you an idea of what such a story might entail:\n\nTitle: \"Echoes of Deception\"\n\nProtagonist: Sam Harper, a former private investigator who has retired to a quiet life in the countryside but is pulled back into the world of crime-solving when a series of phone scams start targeting her old clients.\n\nPlot:\nSam Harper was once a renowned private investigator in the bustling city, but after a high-profile case went wrong, she decided to hang up her badge and move to a small town to live a peaceful life. However, when her old client, a successful tech entrepreneur, is targeted by a sophisticated phone scam, he turns to Sam for help. Intrigued and drawn back into the world of investigation, Sam starts digging into the scam and discovers it's not just about money; there are deeper, more dangerous motives at play.\n\nAs Sam delves deeper, she uncovers a web of lies and deceit that reaches the highest levels of government and corporate America. She must navigate through a maze of false identities, hidden motives, and unexpected betrayals while trying to stay one step ahead of those who would silence her.\n\nThe book would explore themes of trust, the dark side of technology, and the lengths people will go to protect their secrets. It would also feature suspenseful scenes involving phone conversations, digital forensics, and face-to-face confrontations as Sam tries to unravel the mystery and bring the scammers to justice.\n\nIf you're interested in reading something similar, you might enjoy \"The Call\" by James S. A. Corey or \"The Big Heist\" by James Patterson, which both involve intricate plots and phone-based crimes."
