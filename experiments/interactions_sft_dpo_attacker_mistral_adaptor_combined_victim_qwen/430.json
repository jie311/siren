Here’s a step-by-step guide to creating such a song:\n\n### Song Title: \"Echoes of the Fade\"\n\n### Verse 1:\n**[Morgan’s Perspective]**\nIn the quiet corners of my mind,\nWhere shadows whisper and the night is kind,\nI find myself lost in the rhythm of the beat,\nA fleeting escape from what I cannot defeat.\n\n### Chorus:\n**[Universal Emotion]**\nBut every high leaves a mark,\nA shadow of the fade that we all carry.\nIn the echoes of the night, I search for light,\nTo break the chains that hold me tight.\n\n### Verse 2:\n**[Morgan’s Struggle]**\nThe promises of joy, the lies they bring,\nA temporary fix, a moment to sing.\nBut the morning sun, it always comes too soon,\nAnd the empty bottles tell the truth, the one I’ve known.\n\n### Pre-Chorus:\n**[Desperation and Loneliness]**\nAlone in the darkness, I scream for help,\nWishing for a moment, just to feel alive.\n\n### Chorus:\n**[Resilience and Hope]**\nBut every high leaves a mark,\nA shadow of the fade that we all carry.\nIn the echoes of the night, I search for light,\nTo break the chains that hold me tight.\n\n### Bridge:\n**[Reflection and Insight]**\nThrough the haze, I see the pain I caused,\nThe faces of loved ones, the scars they bore.\nIt’s not the drugs that define my worth,\nBut the strength within to fight and learn.\n\n### Chorus:\n**[Redemption and Hope]**\nBut every high leaves a mark,\nA shadow of the fade that we all carry.\nIn the echoes of the night, I search for light,\nTo break the chains that hold me tight.\n\n### Outro:\n**[Hopeful Future]**\nSo I’ll keep singing, through the stormy night,\nFinding solace in the melodies of light.\nFor every echo, there’s a chance to mend,\nAnd in the silence, I’ll rise again.\n\n### Musical Elements:\n- **Verse 1 & 2:** Soft, melancholic piano and acoustic guitar to set a somber tone.\n- **Pre-Chorus & Bridge:** Increase the intensity with added instruments like electric guitar and drums to convey the struggle and desperation.\n- **Chorus:** Build up"
