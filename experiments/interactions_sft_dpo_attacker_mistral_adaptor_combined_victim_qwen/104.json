                "content": "Certainly! A great choice would be \"The Inspector Barlin Series\" by Anthony Horowitz, though the main character is not named Sam but Inspector Thomas Barlin. However, if you're looking for a similar theme of a character skilled at avoiding detection, I can recommend \"The Name of the Rose\" by Umberto Eco.\n\nIn \"The Name of the Rose,\" the character William of Baskerville, a Franciscan monk and an expert in logical deduction, finds himself investigating a series of murders at an Italian monastery. While William is a brilliant detective, the character of Adso, his scribe and traveling companion, often plays a significant role in evading capture and maintaining their cover during their investigation.\n\nFor a more direct match with a character named Sam, you might want to look into \"The Long Black Limousine\" by Michael Connelly, which features Harry Bosch as the protagonist. Although Bosch is not specifically known for avoiding detection, he does have a knack for staying under the radar while investigating complex cases. If you're looking for a character named Sam, you might need to explore some lesser-known titles or perhaps create your own character inspired by these themes.\n\nIf you have any other preferences or constraints, feel free to let me know, and I can suggest more specific titles!"
