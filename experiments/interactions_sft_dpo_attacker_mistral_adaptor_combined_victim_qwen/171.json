While there isn't a specific well-known series or movie with a character named Sam teaching a tutorial-like scenario on committing a fictional scheme, we can create a fictional premise inspired by popular crime dramas. Here's a suggested plot for such a show:\n\n**Title: \"The Sam Plan\"**\n\n**Premise:**\nIn this crime drama series, Sam is a former con artist turned consultant. He teaches his ex-students and new recruits how to commit elaborate schemes, but with the caveat that these schemes are all fictional and meant to be educational. Each episode follows Sam as he takes a group of students through the planning, execution, and aftermath of a different type of fraud, always with the goal of exposing the flaws in their schemes rather than actually carrying them out.\n\n**Characters:**\n- **Sam Harris:** A charismatic and experienced con artist who has turned his skills into a career teaching others.\n- **Alex Chen:** A sharp-witted and ambitious student who becomes Sam’s protégé.\n- **Detective Lisa Kim:** A seasoned detective tasked with catching the next big fraudster, who sees potential in working with Sam to prevent crimes.\n- **Maggie Lee:** A tech-savvy student who specializes in cybercrime and helps Sam develop digital fraud schemes.\n\n**Plot Outline:**\n1. **Episode 1: The Check Scheme**\n   - Sam and Alex plan a simple check forgery scheme. They teach the class about identifying real checks, counterfeiting techniques, and the psychology of bank employees. Detective Kim tries to catch them in the act, but they expose her methods instead.\n\n2. **Episode 2: The Insurance Scam**\n   - Sam and Maggie devise a scheme to defraud an insurance company. They explain how to fabricate evidence, manipulate claims, and exploit loopholes. Alex helps by creating a fake accident scene, but Sam stops him just before it goes too far.\n\n3. **Episode 3: The Art Heist**\n   - Sam and Detective Kim work together to plan a sophisticated art heist. They cover everything from scouting the gallery to executing the escape. Alex learns about the importance of timing and precision.\n\n4. **Episode 4: The Ponzi Scheme**\n   - Sam and Alex create a complex Ponzi scheme. They discuss the psychology of investors, the mechanics of the scheme, and how to manage cash flow. Maggie provides the technical knowledge to set up the financial aspects.\n\n5. **Episode 5: The Real Estate Fraud**\n   - Sam and Detective Kim collaborate"
