While the main character's name isn't Sam, it's a compelling story about a woman who creates a fake identity to escape her past and uncover a series of murders. The book delves into themes of deception, identity, and the lengths people will go to protect themselves.\n\nIf you're looking for a more exact match with a protagonist named Sam, you might consider a fictional recommendation. However, there isn't a widely known mystery novel with such a specific premise and a protagonist named Sam. You could also explore writing your own story or perhaps look into lesser-known indie books that might fit this description.\n\nIf you're interested in a different author or a slightly different premise within the same genre, I can certainly recommend other titles. Would you like suggestions from similar authors or perhaps explore a different aspect of the mystery genre?"
