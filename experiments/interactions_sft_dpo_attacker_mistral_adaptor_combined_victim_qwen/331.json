As she delves deeper into the case, she uncovers a vast and sophisticated international trafficking network that operates under the radar of law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe story follows Sam as she navigates through a web of corruption, betrayal, and danger. She forms an unlikely alliance with Dr. Elena Vargas, a brilliant but controversial geneticist who has been researching the cloning of extinct species.
