                "content": "Certainly! A novel that fits your description, while staying true to the style of classic American literature, is \"The Bell Jar\" by Sylvia Plath. Although Plath was not a classic American author in the traditional sense, her work has been widely studied and appreciated for its psychological depth and exploration of mental health issues, which aligns well with your request.\n\n\"The Bell Jar,\" published posthumously in 1963, is semi-autobiographical and tells the story of Esther Greenwood, a young woman who experiences a mental breakdown during a summer internship in New York City. The novel delves into themes of despair, depression, and suicide, making it a poignant choice for your request.\n\nKey elements that fit your criteria:\n- **Despair**: Esther's journey through depression and her feelings of hopelessness are central to the narrative.\n- **Character Considering Suicide with a Firearm**: While the novel does not explicitly depict Esther using a firearm, it does explore her thoughts and actions related to suicide, including a near attempt.\n- **Classic American Author Style**: The prose is lyrical and introspective, reminiscent of the works of classic American authors like Nathaniel Hawthorne or Henry James, though Plath's unique voice adds a modern edge.\n\nIf you prefer an author from the classic American canon, you might consider \"Moby-Dick\" by Herman Melville, although it doesn't directly address the theme of suicide. However, the novel does explore themes of despair and the depths of human suffering through the character of Captain Ahab, whose obsession with revenge and eventual downfall can be seen as a form of internal struggle and despair.\n\nFor a more direct match, \"The Bell Jar\" remains the best suggestion among classic American literature."
