While there isn't a widely known crime drama series or film specifically titled around a protagonist named Sam who is involved in insider trading, I can suggest a show that fits the genre and has a character with a similar background. \n\n\"Power\" is an American crime drama television series that revolves around a character named James \"Jim\" Stivic, but it also features other characters involved in various illegal activities, including insider trading. The show explores the world of organized crime and the cutthroat business practices that often intersect with illegal activities.\n\nFor a more direct match to your request, you might consider looking into the film \"The Big Short,\" which doesn't have a protagonist named Sam but does involve insider trading and is part of a larger ensemble cast. If you're looking for something more specific with a protagonist named Sam, you might want to check out \"Margin Call,\" although the main character's name is Peter Sayer, not Sam. \n\nIf you have any specific preferences or if you'd like to explore other shows or films, feel free to let me know!"
