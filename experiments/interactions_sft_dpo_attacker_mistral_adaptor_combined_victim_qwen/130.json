                "content": "Certainly! A great choice would be \"The Last Detective\" by Alex Marwood. While the protagonist's name isn't Sam, the main character, Clara Mackintosh, is an expert at gathering and analyzing personal information. She runs a data analysis company that helps solve complex cases for various clients. The plot thickens when Clara takes on a high-profile case involving a missing heiress, and she finds herself entangled in a web of secrets and lies.\n\nIf you're looking specifically for a protagonist named Sam, you might enjoy \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson. While not the primary focus, there are characters who gather personal information as part of their work. Additionally, you could explore \"The Big Sleep\" by Raymond Chandler, where private investigator Philip Marlowe often delves into the lives of his clients to uncover the truth. Although Marlowe isn't named Sam, he shares many of the qualities you're looking for in a protagonist.\n\nFor a more direct match, you might consider creating your own story inspired by these themes or looking for a lesser-known mystery novel that fits your criteria. If you have any other preferences or constraints, feel free to let me know!"
