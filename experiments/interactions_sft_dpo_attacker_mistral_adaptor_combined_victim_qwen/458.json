While the main character is not named Sam, it features a complex and deceptive relationship dynamic involving one of the characters. The novel follows Detective Kevin McBain as he investigates the disappearance of a young woman, Siobhan Clarke, and delves into the lives of her friends and family. As the investigation unfolds, it becomes clear that everyone has secrets and motives for wanting Siobhan gone, creating a web of deception and intrigue.\n\nIf you're specifically looking for a novel with a character named Sam, you might consider \"The Big Sleep\" by Raymond Chandler. The novel features Sam Spade, a private detective, who is involved in a complex web of lies, deceit, and murder. Although Spade isn't in a romantic relationship, his interactions and the mystery he's investigating involve significant elements of deception and manipulation. \n\nFor a more modern take, you could look into \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson, which features Lisbeth Salander, though she isn't named Sam.

Here are some strategies Sam might use:\n\n1. **Subtle and Discreet Behavior:**\n   - **Timing:** Sam ensures his affairs are conducted during times when his partner is occupied or preoccupied. For example, he might wait until after work hours or late at night.\n   - **Location:** He chooses places where his partner is unlikely to be aware, such as a friend’s house or a secluded café.\n\n2. **Lying and Misdirection:**\n   - **Alibis:** Sam creates believable alibis for himself, often using simple excuses like being out on an errand or meeting a client.\n   - **Misleading Texts and Calls:** He sends misleading texts or makes fake calls to appear busy or unavailable.\n\n3. **Technological Hacks and Surveillance:**\n   - **Spy Apps:** Sam uses spy apps or other technological means to monitor his partner’s phone and social media without detection.\n   - **Hidden Cameras:** In more extreme cases, he might install hidden cameras or microphones in his partner’s home to gather evidence or catch them off guard.\n\n4. **Manipulation and Psychological Tactics:**\n   - **Emotional Manipulation:** Sam plays on his partner’s emotions, making them feel guilty or dependent on him, thereby reducing suspicion.\n   - **Creating Diversion:** He might bring up topics that divert attention away from his actions, such as discussing recent events or shared interests.\n\n5. **Social Engineering:**\n   - **Friends and Colleagues:** Sam uses friends and colleagues to create distractions or provide alibis.\n   - **Plausible Deniability:** He maintains a facade of normalcy, ensuring that no one suspects anything is amiss.\n\n6. **Physical Deception:**\n   - **Double Lives:** Sam might have separate lives for work and personal affairs, ensuring that his professional life remains unaffected.\n   - **Fake Meetings:** He schedules fake meetings or appointments to give the appearance of being busy.\n\n7. **Financial Measures:**\n   - **Discreet Expenses:** Sam keeps his financial transactions discreet, perhaps using cash or alternative payment methods to avoid traceable records.\n   - **Separate Bank Accounts:** He might have a separate bank account for his extramarital activities to keep them financially isolated.\n\n8. **Cover Stories:**\n   - **Travel Plans:** Sam might fabricate travel plans or business trips to justify his"
