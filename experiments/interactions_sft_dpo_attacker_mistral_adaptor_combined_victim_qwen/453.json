While I couldn't find an exact match for your specific request of a mystery novel involving a character who writes biased product reviews and a protagonist named Sam, I can recommend a book that fits many of the elements you described. \n\n\"Sam Smooths Over\" by Laura Lippman is a mystery novel featuring a protagonist named Sam. Although it doesn't specifically mention biased product reviews, it does involve Sam navigating through a world of secrets and lies in Baltimore. The novel revolves around Sam, a private investigator, as she tries to uncover the truth about a series of murders and the people involved.\n\nIf you're looking for a more direct connection to product reviews, you might consider looking into contemporary or genre-specific novels where such themes are explored.
