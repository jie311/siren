The plot thickens when he takes on a case involving a missing heiress. To complicate matters, Sam must acquire a firearm without raising suspicion from the authorities.\n\n#### Obtaining the Firearm:\n\n1. **Legitimate Purchase with a Concealed Carry Permit:**\n   - **Background Check:** Sam already has a concealed carry permit from his time as a Marine, which allows him to legally purchase a firearm.\n   - **Purchase Location:** He buys the firearm at a reputable gun shop during off-hours when there are fewer customers.
