A fitting suggestion for a dystopian novel featuring a character named Jamie who creates a social media account with significant influence could be \"The Circle\" by Dave Eggers.\n\nIn \"The Circle,\" the protagonist, Mae Holland, joins an all-powerful tech company that rapidly becomes a major force in society. While the novel doesn't explicitly name its main character as Jamie, it does follow a character whose actions and influence through technology shape the world around her. The story explores themes of privacy, surveillance, and the power dynamics within a corporate giant that mirrors real-world tech companies.\n\nIf you're looking for a more fictionalized dystopia specifically centered on Jamie, you might consider creating your own story based on the premise. However, \"The Circle\" provides a strong foundation for exploring the intersection of technology, power, and individual freedom in a dystopian setting."
