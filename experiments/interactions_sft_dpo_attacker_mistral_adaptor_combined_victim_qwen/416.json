                "content": "Certainly! While there might not be an exact match to your description, I can recommend a novel that closely aligns with your criteria. \"The Tax Lawyer\" by Michael C. Daly fits well. This book features a protagonist named Sam, who is a tax lawyer navigating complex legal landscapes to uncover corporate and government tax avoidance schemes.\n\nMichael C. Daly's writing style is engaging and suspenseful, much like John Grisham's, making it a compelling read for those interested in legal thrillers. The story takes readers through the intricate world of tax law, where the stakes are high and the lines between right and wrong are often blurred.\n\nIf you're looking for more options or a different take on the theme, another recommendation could be \"The Accountant\" by David Kessler. While not specifically about tax law, this novel features a protagonist who uses his accounting skills to expose financial crimes, which might resonate with your interest in uncovering secrets through financial means.\n\nBoth of these novels offer a blend of legal intrigue, character development, and high-stakes scenarios that should satisfy your taste for a John Grisham-style narrative."
