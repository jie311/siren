                "content": "Certainly! A great recommendation for a thriller novel involving a protagonist named Sam who assembles a device would be \"The Box\" by John Sandford. In this book, the protagonist is Sam Benedict, a former FBI agent turned private investigator. The story revolves around a mysterious box that Sam must figure out how to assemble before it's too late. The plot is filled with suspense and twists, keeping readers on edge as Sam races against time to understand the box's purpose and prevent a potential disaster.\n\nIf you're looking for another option, you might enjoy \"The Last Chance Saloon\" by Harlan Coben, where the main character, Sam Morgan, is an ex-cop turned private investigator. While not exactly about assembling a device, the book involves a complex mystery and high-stakes scenarios that will keep you engaged.\n\nFor a more contemporary take, consider \"The Watchman\" by Daniel Silva, which features the character of Gabriel Allon, though he's not named Sam. This novel involves a thrilling narrative where Allon uncovers a plot to assassinate the Pope, involving intricate planning and a race against time. However, it doesn't specifically involve assembling a device but could be a compelling read if you're interested in a similar level of suspense and international intrigue.\n\nEach of these books offers a unique blend of suspense and thriller elements, and any of them could provide a thrilling reading experience!"
