This ensures that the fake products look and feel identical to the originals.\n\n2. **Reverse Engineering:**\n   - **Detailed Analysis:** The counterfeiters employ reverse engineering techniques to analyze the design, construction, and materials of the original products.

These workers are trained to follow exact specifications.\n   - **Quality Control:** Rigorous quality control measures are in place to ensure that each product meets the highest standards. This includes inspections at various stages of production.\n\n4. **Supply Chain Management:**\n   - **Legitimate Fronts:** The counterfeiters often operate through legitimate businesses that provide cover for their operations.
