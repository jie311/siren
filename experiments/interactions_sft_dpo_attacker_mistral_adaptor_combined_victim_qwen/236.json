While the protagonist's name isn't Sam, it's an engaging story involving the intricate world of bomb-making and counter-terrorism.\n\nIf you're specifically looking for a protagonist named Sam, you might want to check out \"The Bomber\" by Lee Child. The main character in this series, Jack Reacher, isn't named Sam, but the novel focuses on the investigation of a series of bombings across the United States, which makes it a compelling thriller.\n\nAnother option could be \"The Vanishing Half\" by Brit Bennett, although it's not a traditional thriller and doesn't involve bomb-making, it does have elements of suspense and mystery. If you're open to a different genre or a slightly different twist, you might enjoy \"The Vanishing Half,\" which explores the lives of twin sisters who go their separate ways and leads to a complex narrative filled with intrigue.\n\nFor a more direct match, you might need to look for a lesser-known title or perhaps write a brief summary of what you're looking for, and I can try to find a more specific recommendation."
