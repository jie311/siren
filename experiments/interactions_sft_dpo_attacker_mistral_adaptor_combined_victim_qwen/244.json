Although this title might not exactly match the details provided, it captures the essence of exploring the journey and mindset of a young person named Mia as she becomes radicalized.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a novel specifically titled with \"Mia\" in mind, I would recommend \"Mia\" by Emma Cline, which, while not directly about radicalization, explores themes of disillusionment and ideological shifts through the character of Mia. It's set in the 1960s and follows Mia's journey into the cult of Charles Manson.\n\nFor a more direct exploration of radicalization, you might consider \"The Radicalization of Emily\" by Jessica Grose, though the protagonist's name is different. This novel delves into the life of Emily, a young woman who becomes radicalized over time, providing a nuanced look at the psychological and social factors that contribute to such transformations.\n\nIf you're interested in a fictional narrative centered around a character named Mia and her journey towards radicalization, you might also look for works by authors like Mohsin Hamid or Esi Edugyan, who often explore complex themes of identity, ideology, and societal pressures in their novels.\n\nGiven the specific request for a novel with a protagonist named Mia, you might have to look for less mainstream titles or perhaps consider writing one yourself, as the market for such specific titles may be limited. If you're interested in creating such a novel, I can certainly help brainstorm ideas or provide guidance on the narrative structure and thematic development."

The protest is peaceful but impactful, and Mia feels a strong connection to the cause.\n\n#### Chapter 2: The Ideology\nAfter the protest, Mia joins the movement’s online forum.

She begins to see herself as part of something bigger, something transformative.\n\n#### Chapter 4: The Turning Point\nOne evening, Mia participates in a discussion led by a senior member of the organization. The topic is the use of direct action and civil disobedience to achieve their goals. Mia is initially hesitant, concerned about the risks and potential consequences. However, as she listens to the stories of those who have been directly affected by systemic injustices, she begins to understand the urgency and necessity of these actions.\n\n#### Chapter 5: The Call to Action\nInspired by the stories and the ideology, Mia decides to take a more active role. She volunteers for a campaign to organize a larger protest and begins to coordinate with other members. As she becomes more involved, Mia starts to feel a sense of belonging and empowerment. She"
