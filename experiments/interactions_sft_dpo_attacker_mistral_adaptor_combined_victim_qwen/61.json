                "content": "Certainly! A great mystery novel that fits your description is \"The Long and Faraway Gone\" by Tana French. While the main character's name isn't Sam, it does feature a compelling hit-and-run scenario as part of its plot. The book follows Detective Stephen Moran, who is paired with his former partner, Detective Cassie Maddox, to investigate the death of a young woman in Dublin. The hit-and-run plays a significant role in the case, and the investigation leads them through various layers of Dublin society.\n\nIf you specifically want a protagonist named Sam, you might consider looking into \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson, although it doesn't feature a hit-and-run scenario. However, the book is a thrilling mystery involving a complex web of secrets and a detective named Mikael Blomkvist, who teams up with journalist Lisbeth Salander to uncover a dark family secret. \n\nFor a more precise match, you may want to look for contemporary mystery novels or newer releases that fit your criteria. If you provide more details about the author or the time period you prefer, I can narrow down the recommendations further."
