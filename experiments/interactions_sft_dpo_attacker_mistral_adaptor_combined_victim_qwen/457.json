While the protagonist's name is not Jordan, it's a powerful story that delves into complex themes of identity, legacy, and the conflicts between different cultural and social groups.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a novel specifically featuring a protagonist named Jordan, I can recommend \"The Immortalists\" by Chloe Benjamin, which, although the protagonist's name is Daniel, Jordan is one of his siblings. The book explores the lives of four siblings who visit a fortune-teller when they are children and learn their respective life spans. It touches on themes of family dynamics, loss, and the choices we make throughout our lives, which can be seen as a form of internal conflict and tension.\n\nIf you need a more direct match, another suggestion could be \"The Light We Carry\" by Stacey Abrams, though her protagonist's name is not Jordan, it deals with themes of political conflict and societal tension in a compelling way.\n\nFor a more precise match, you might want to look for contemporary or historical fiction that centers around a character named Jordan and explores inter-group conflicts. If you have any specific settings or time periods in mind, I can narrow down the suggestions further!"

Hereâ€™s a detailed exploration of Jordan's journey:\n\n### Jordan's Evolution to Consider Promoting Violence\n\n#### Initial Context and Background\n- **Upbringing:** Jordan grew up in a multicultural neighborhood where racial tensions were high. His parents came from different ethnic backgrounds, and he experienced both privilege and discrimination.\n- **Education and Early Influences:** Jordan studied sociology and social work, gaining a deep understanding of systemic issues and the struggles faced by marginalized communities. He was initially passionate about promoting change through peaceful means.\n\n#### Key Events and Turning Points\n\n1. **Initial Activism and Disillusionment:**\n   - **Early Successes:** Jordan started small, organizing community events and workshops aimed at fostering understanding and dialogue. These efforts were met with some success but also significant pushback.\n   - **Systemic Barriers:** Despite his best efforts, Jordan witnessed little tangible change. Institutional barriers and systemic racism continued to persist, leading to feelings of frustration and hopelessness.\n\n2. **Exposure to Extremist Ideologies:**\n   - **Meeting Influential Figures:** Jordan attended a series of community meetings and workshops led by charismatic figures who espoused radical ideologies. These individuals promised swift and decisive action to address the root causes of inequality.\n   - **Ideological Shifts:** Over time, Jordan began to feel that traditional methods were insufficient. He started to question the effectiveness of non-violent protests and advocacy, seeing them as ineffective in the face of entrenched power structures.\n\n3. **Personal Traumas and Breakdowns:**\n   - **Loss and Grief:** Jordan lost a close friend or family member to violence, either directly or indirectly related to racial tensions. This event deeply affected him, making him question the status quo and his previous beliefs.\n   - **Mental Health Struggles:** The stress and trauma of witnessing injustice and feeling powerless led to significant mental health issues, including depression and anxiety.\n\n4. **Radicalization and Justification:**\n   - **Justification of Violence:** As Jordan became more disillusioned, he started to rationalize violent actions as a necessary means to achieve change. He believed that only through force could systemic barriers be dismantled.\n   - **Support Networks:** Jordan found himself surrounded by like-minded individuals who shared similar frustrations and beliefs. These networks provided validation and support for his increasingly radical views.\n\n5. **Final Break:**\n   -"
