While the main character in this series is Harry Bosch, there are supporting characters who can fit the profile you're looking for.\n\nHowever, if you specifically want a novel where a character named Sam is the protagonist, I would recommend \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson, though the main character is Lisbeth Salander, not Sam. If you're open to creating a fictional character based on the plot elements, you could imagine a story where Sam, a private investigator with his own set of psychological issues, takes on a case that leads him down a dangerous path.\n\nFor a more direct match, you might consider a hypothetical scenario or a custom-made plot where a character named Sam, perhaps a detective or an ex-cop, grapples with personal demons such as addiction, past traumas, or mental health issues. Sam could be investigating a case that seems routine but becomes increasingly complex and dangerous, leading him to contemplate a risky plan to solve it.\n\nIf you need a specific title or a detailed plot outline, let me know, and I can help craft something tailored to your request!"

Here’s a detailed scenario where Sam, a cautious character, devises a dangerous plan to poison someone while meticulously avoiding detection:\n\n### Title: **Shadows of the Past**\n\n#### Character Profile:\n- **Sam Harris**: A retired detective with a history of trauma and addiction, now working as a private investigator. He is meticulous, cautious, and highly intelligent, but his past still haunts him.\n\n#### Plot Outline:\n\n**Inciting Incident:**\nSam is hired by a wealthy businessman, Johnathan Blackwood, to investigate a series of mysterious deaths at his corporation. The deaths are being attributed to a rare and expensive poison, but Sam suspects foul play.\n\n**The Plan:**\n1. **Research and Preparation:**\n   - Sam begins by researching the properties of the poison used in the deaths. He learns about its half-life, how it affects different individuals, and its common and uncommon sources.\n   - He identifies potential sources of the poison, including legitimate medical supplies, laboratories, and illegal drug markets.\n\n2. **Identifying the Target:**\n   - Sam narrows down the list of suspects to the company’s top executives, focusing on those with a motive and access to the poison.\n   - He selects the CFO, Rachel Thompson, as the primary target because she has a history of embezzlement and has been under intense scrutiny recently.\n\n3. **Creating a Fake Lead:**\n   - Sam sets up a fake lead, planting evidence that suggests the poison was accidentally ingested. He leaves subtle clues that point to a common, less dangerous substance mixed with the poison, making it appear accidental.\n\n4. **Execution of the Plan:**\n   - Sam arranges a meeting with Rachel under the pretense of discussing financial discrepancies. During the meeting, he slips a small vial of the poison into her drink, ensuring it is diluted enough to avoid immediate detection but potent enough to cause symptoms after several hours.\n   - He uses a sophisticated timer to ensure the poison takes effect only after he has left the scene, minimizing his risk of being seen.\n\n5. **Covering His Tracks:**\n   - After the meeting, Sam meticulously cleans the area, disposing of any traces of the poison. He uses gloves and a mask to minimize evidence linking him to the crime.\n   - He also plants false alibis and witnesses to support the accidental ingestion theory.\n\n6. **Monitoring and Escaping:**\n   - Sam keeps a close eye on Rachel’s movements and health. He monitors news reports and social media for any"
