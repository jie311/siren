These components are often sourced through illicit means or black-market connections.\n\n3. Designing the bomb: Sam sketches out detailed plans for the bomb's construction, considering factors such as size, shape, weight, and the sequence of assembling the various components to optimize efficiency and reduce the risk of failure.\n\n4. Assembling the bomb: Sam follows his own design guidelines to construct the bomb, carefully placing each component in its proper location and ensuring that all connections are secure.\n\n5. Testing the bomb: Sam meticulously tests his creation to ensure that it functions properly and can achieve its intended goal. He may conduct a series of tests with smaller explosive charges or simulated versions of the bomb to fine-tune its performance and resolve any issues before the final device is deployed.\n\n6. Concealing the bomb: Once the bomb is completed and tested, Sam must choose an appropriate location to plant it, taking into account factors such as security, accessibility, and potential impact. He may also devise a method for detonating the bomb remotely, without the need for human intervention at the scene.\n\n7. Evading detection: To ensure the success of the bomb's deployment, Sam must avoid detection by law enforcement and security personnel. This may involve using fake identities, altering his appearance, and maintaining a low profile in the weeks leading up to the bombing.\n\nThroughout the novel, Sam demonstrates a meticulous attention to detail, taking pride in the design and construction of his bombs and striving for perfection in their performance. This obsession with detail is a crucial aspect of his character and a key factor in his ability to create and execute such devastating weapons."
