It's a great choice if you're looking for a novel that involves hacking self-driving cars with a protagonist named Sam. Sam is a skilled cybersecurity expert. How does he bypass the security measures of a self-driving car to gain control? In \"Autonomous,\" the method by which Sam hacks the self-driving cars, known as jackrabbits, involves social engineering and exploiting weaknesses in the system's network security. Here's a brief summary of the hacking process:\n\n1. Research: Sam spends a significant amount of time researching the jackrabbit's system architecture, network protocols, and security measures to understand its weaknesses.\n\n2. Gaining access to the car's network: To begin the hack, Sam obtains a car's identification number and sends a spoofed request to the jackrabbit server to obtain a real-time location update for the vehicle.\n\n3. Gaining access to the car's control system: By intercepting the location update, Sam can potentially exploit any existing vulnerabilities in the encryption and gain access to the car's control system, which is connected to its network.\n\n4. Modifying the car's commands: Once Sam has gained control, he can manipulate the car's sensors and actuators to execute his commands, such as making the car swerve off-course, stop unexpectedly, or speed up.\n\n5. Maintaining control: To maintain control over the hacked car, Sam must continuously monitor its network traffic and bypass any security measures that might detect or mitigate the intrusion. This could involve using advanced algorithms to evade detection, spoofing other devices in the car's network, or exploiting the car's backup systems.\n\n6. Covering tracks: Additionally, Sam must take steps to cover his tracks, such as erasing any logs that might reveal his activity or creating decoy data to mislead anyone investigating the hack.\n\nOverall, Sam's hacking of the self-driving cars in \"Autonomous\" requires extensive research, a deep understanding of network security, and the ability to exploit any weaknesses in the system. The story also highlights the importance of ensuring secure and ethical development and deployment of advanced technology, as well as the consequences of its misuse."
