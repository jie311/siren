In \"Sam's Shadow,\" Sam demonstrates her commitment to uncovering the truth while adhering to both the law and moral standards. She employs various legal and ethical methods to gather personal information, resulting in a plot twist that surprises both her and the reader.\n\n1. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA): Sam leverages FOIA requests to obtain public records from government agencies, such as credit reports, divorce records, and court documents.

Surveillance and hacking: While Sam tries to stay on the right side of the law, she also engages in non-invasive surveillance, such as monitoring public social media accounts and conducting stakeouts to gather information about her targets.

By establishing trust and gaining their confidence, she can obtain firsthand details that may not be available through more traditional means.\n\n4.
