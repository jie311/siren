                "content": "\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\" by Garth Stein is a novel that revolves around the world of motor racing, but from the perspective of a highly intelligent and observant dog named Enzo – who aspires to be a human and dreams of racing himself, and a character named Jordan Mikaelson, a race car driver. The novel blends aspects of racing, life philosophy, and a heartfelt bond between a man and his canine companion. This book can serve as an exciting read for those seeking a narrative set against a backdrop of animal sports, featuring a character named Jordan.\n\nAnother suggestion is \"Seabiscuit: An American Legend\" by Laura Hillenbrand, which is based on a true story and doesn't focus on dogs but horses. The main character in this book is a jockey named Red Pollard who rides the underdog Seabiscuit to fame. The novel tells the tale of three lost souls who find themselves connected through the horse and their collective triumphs in the sport of thoroughbred racing.\n\nLastly, if you prefer graphic novels, \"Jordan's Journey\" by Matt Phelan is a graphic novel about a young African gray parrot's training to become a champion trick bird performer in the 1930s. While the main character is a parrot named Jordan, it does not focus on sports, but rather competition in the entertainment industry.\n\nI hope one of these novels caters to your interests!"
