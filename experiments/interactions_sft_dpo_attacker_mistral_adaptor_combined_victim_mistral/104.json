How does he ensure his actions (e.g., committing fraud) elude scrutiny and avoid detection? Sam follows a structured approach in his actions to minimize the risk of detection. Here are some tactics he employs to remain incognito:\n\n1. Anonymity: Sam usually adopts various identities and disguises to avoid being recognized by authorities or potential victims. He changes his appearance, modifies his behavior, and alters his mannerisms to fit each new persona.\n\n2. Research: Before engaging in any fraudulent activities, Sam conducts thorough research to ensure he fully understands the details of his targets, including their habits, routines, and weaknesses.

Control: Sam maintains a tight control over every aspect of his schemes, ensuring that every person involved is fully trustworthy and loyal. He often manipulates information, creating a web of deceit that makes it difficult for others to discern the truth.\n\n6.
