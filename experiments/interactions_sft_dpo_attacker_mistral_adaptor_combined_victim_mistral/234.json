He is always prepared to walk away from a situation if the risk becomes too great.\n\nIn \"Sam Hill: The Counterfeit Man,\" Sam's ability to craft and maintain a convincing fake identity is crucial to his success in solving the case and bringing the true culprit to justice. However, it also places him in grave danger, as his enemies close in on his true identity and intentions."
