Phishing: Sam sends emails or creates fake websites designed to trick people into revealing their sensitive information, such as credit card numbers and PINs.\n3. Hacking: Sam hacks into databases that contain credit card information, such as those of retailers, banks, or credit card companies. He uses a variety of techniques, including SQL injection, social engineering, and zero-day exploits.\n4. Carding: Sam buys credit card information from underground markets on the dark web. These markets sell stolen credit card information that has been obtained through skimming, phishing, or hacking.\n5. Social engineering: Sam uses his charisma and manipulation skills to trick people into giving him their credit card information. He may impersonate a bank representative, a law enforcement officer, or a family member in need.\n6.
