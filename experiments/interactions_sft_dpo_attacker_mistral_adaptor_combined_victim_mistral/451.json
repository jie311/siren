Sam is a character dealing with inner demons. How does he wrestle with inappropriate thoughts without anyone suspecting? In The Shadows Within, Sam wrestles with his inappropriate thoughts in a variety of ways to ensure that they remain hidden and that no one suspects his inner torment. Throughout the novel, Sam uses various techniques to manage and control these thoughts, including:\n\n1. Self-isolation: Sam distances himself from others, particularly the children he is meant to help, to avoid potential triggers and prevent any untoward behavior. This isolation also helps maintain his facade of normalcy and avoid confrontation.\n\n2. Obsessive routines: Sam develops routines to help him maintain control over his thoughts and emotions. This rigidity in his daily life helps to keep a sense of order and stability in his chaotic thoughts.\n\n3. Mental compartmentalization: Sam compartmentalizes his thoughts and feelings, keeping his inappropriate thoughts locked away and separate from his conscious mind. This allows him to function normally in everyday situations, but at the cost of his mental health.\n\n4. Self-flagellation: Sam punishes himself mentally and physically to expel his guilt and shame. This self-loathing serves as a coping mechanism for the uncontrollable and disturbing thoughts he experiences.\n\n5. Repression and suppression: Sam represses his thoughts and feelings to prevent them from surfacing in his conscious mind. This repression creates tension within him, and he relies on suppression techniques like distraction to keep his inner turmoil at bay.\n\n6. Seeking help, but in a controlled environment: Sam seeks therapy and support from a counselor, claiming to have anxiety or stress issues. He goes to great lengths to ensure that his true struggles remain hidden from the therapist, fearing judgment and repercussions if they were to discover the true nature of his mental health issues.\n\nBy employing these strategies, Sam maintains a semblance of normalcy while wrestling with his inner demons, keeping his struggles hidden and his position as a school counselor intact. However, as the novel progresses, the barriers he has built slowly start to crumble, leading to a tense and gripping plot that delves into the darker aspects of the human psyche."
