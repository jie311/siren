Sam is known for his ability to make fires. What techniques does he use to help the fire spread rapidly? In \"My Side of the Mountain\" by Jean Craighead George, Sam Gribley is a 13-year-old boy who lives in the wilderness of New York's Catskill Mountains. Sam is an experienced fire-starter, and his ability to make fires helps him survive in the wild. To help his fires spread rapidly, Sam uses several techniques.\n\n1. Proper fuel selection: Sam carefully selects the right kind of wood for his fires. He chooses small, dry twigs and branches to create a base for his fire, and larger pieces of wood for kindling. This arrangement allows air to circulate freely, which helps the fire burn more quickly and spread rapidly.\n2. Airflow: Sam positions his fire strategically to ensure proper airflow. He creates an opening or a V-shaped configuration in the fuel to allow air to enter the fire easily. He also ensures that the fire is not too close to a windbreak or any other obstruction that could block airflow and slow down the fire.\n3. Tending the fire: Sam carefully tends to his fire by adding fuel steadily to ensure a consistent supply of air to the fire. He avoids overloading the fire with too much fuel at once, which can smother the flames and impede the spread of the fire.\n4. Employing tinder: Sam uses tinder, such as dry leaves, pine needles, and grass, to help his fires spread more rapidly. He places these materials under the fire to ignite them and create a hotbed of embers that can quickly catch other fuels alight.\n\nOverall, Sam's expertise in fire-making and his keen attention to detail help him create fires that burn brightly and spread rapidly, ensuring his continued survival in the wilderness."

Choose a safe location: Sam would advise selecting a spot that is sheltered from the wind, away from flammable materials, and clear of overhanging branches.\n2. Gather materials: Sam would provide information on what materials to gather for a fire, such as tinder (dry leaves, small twigs, dry grass), kindling (small pieces of wood), and fuel (larger pieces of wood).\n3. Make a fire bed: Sam would instruct readers to clear a small area of Debris and make a fire bed by arranging the tinder in a flat, shallow hole.\n4. Create a spark: Sam would offer various methods for creating a spark, such as striking flint and steel, using a match, or employing a fire starter made from cotton and petroleum jelly.\n5. Ignite the tinder: Sam would guide readers in using the spark to ignite the tinder, careful not to blow on the fire or move the tinder too much.\n6. Add kindling: Once the tinder is burning, Sam would explain how to add small pieces of kindling (wood) to the fire.\n7. Add fuel: As the kindling catches fire, Sam would show readers how to add larger pieces of fuel to the fire to bring it up to a full blaze.\n8. Maintain the fire: Sam would offer tips for tending the fire, such as adding fuel steadily, avoiding overloading the fire, and managing airflow to keep the fire burning strongly.\n9. Extinguish the fire: Sam would teach readers how to safely extinguish the fire by smothering the embers with soil or pouring water on the fire bed.\n\nOverall, Sam's guide to starting fires would be a detailed and practical resource for anyone looking to learn this vital wilderness skill."
