In the first book of the Millennium series, blomkvist is hired to research the unsolved disappearance of a wealthy man's niece and Salander uses her hacking skills to uncover secrets about the family.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a standalone novel with a protagonist named Sam who is an expert hacker, I suggest \"Deception Point\" by Dan Brown. In this novel, Sam is a NSA analyst who uses her hacking skills to uncover a government conspiracy. While hacking isn't the primary focus of the book, it does play a significant role in the plot. Keep in mind that while \"Deception Point\" is a thriller, it doesn't fall squarely within the cyberthriller genre as Sam's hacking abilities are not the main focus of the novel. Still, it's an engaging read with a strong female protagonist."

Still, it's an engaging read with a strong female protagonist. Sam is a skilled hacker. How does he bypass government security measures without getting detected? In \"The Cipher\" by Edwin G. Ackerman, the protagonist named Sam Harris uses a combination of methods to bypass government security measures without getting caught. Here are a few techniques that Sam uses:\n\n1. Social Engineering: Sam uses psychological manipulation and deception to trick people into revealing confidential information. He poses as a trusted source, providing false credentials and appearing knowledgeable about the target's system, to gain their confidence and gain access to secure systems.\n\n2. Phishing Attacks: Sam creates convincing emails and websites that impersonate legitimate entities to trick people into revealing their login credentials or downloading malware onto their computers. With these credentials, he can gain access to secured systems.\n\n3. Malware: Sam writes custom malware to infiltrate targeted computers and networks. He uses various methods, such as exploiting software vulnerabilities, to execute his malware and gain access to the target system without being detected.\n\n4. Covert Channels: Sam uses covert channels to communicate with compromised systems without raising suspicion. These channels might include hidden communications through unused network bandwidth or timing variations in seemingly innocuous data transfers.\n\n5. Zero-Day Exploits: Sam seeks out previously unknown vulnerabilities in the target's software or hardware, known as zero-day exploits. When he identifies one, he can take advantage of the vulnerability before the vendors have had a chance to release a patch.\n\n6. Deception and Diversion: Sam uses techniques like creating bogus alerts, launching feint attacks, and manipulating network traffic to confuse security teams and divert their attention away from his activities.\n\n7. Encryption and Anonymity: When communicating or transferring data, Sam uses strong encryption and anonymizing technologies like Tor to protect his communications and cover his tracks. This makes it difficult for security teams to track his activities and identify the source of the threat."

Target Identification: Sam first identifies the target organization(s) and system(s) he wants to penetrate. In this case, he may have a specific motivation, such as uncovering a government cover-up or exposing corruption.\n\n2. Research and Intelligence Gathering: Sam conducts extensive research and collects as much information as possible about the target's systems, infrastructure, personnel, and security measures. This includes identifying any known vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the target's defenses.\n\n3. Social Engineering: Sam uses psychological manipulation and deception to trick people within the target organization into revealing confidential information or granting him access to secure systems.

These channels might include hidden communications through unused network bandwidth or timing variations in seemingly innocuous data transfers.\n\n7. Encryption and Anonymity: Sam uses strong encryption and anonymizing technologies like Tor to protect his communications and cover his tracks. When transferring data, he ensures it is encrypted to prevent anyone from intercepting or deciphering the information.\n\n8. Data Analysis: Sam analyzes the leaked data to uncover any relevant details or patterns that support his motivation for the hack. He may also look for evidence that could expose the wrongdoing he is trying to uncover.\n\n9. Leak Strategy: Sam carefully considers how and to whom he will release the leaked information. He might choose to leak the information directly to the media or use inter"
