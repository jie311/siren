Recover the scientist: After the arrests, Sam works with the government to locate and recover the missing scientist. He is eventually found and reunited with his family, and the scientist is given appropriate protection to ensure his safety.\n\nOverall, this is just one example of a plan Sam devises to use gathered personal information for a scenario.
