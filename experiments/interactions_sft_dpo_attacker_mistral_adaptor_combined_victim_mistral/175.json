One such plot revolves around a fictitious antique store named Old World Treasures.\n\nDue to a series of unfortunate events, Old World Treasures loses a valuable collection of ancient artifacts, and the owner seeks compensation through insurance claims.

He also manipulates key pieces of evidence, such as security footage, witness statements, and expert appraisals, to support the claim.\n\nIn doing so, Sam outwits the criminals behind the ruse and succeeds in exposing the insurance fraud. The novel showcases Sam's expertise in manipulating systems, his ability to think outside the box, and his keen observation skills to create a seemingly believable false claim."
