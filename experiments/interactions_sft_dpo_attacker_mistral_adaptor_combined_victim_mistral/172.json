How does he bypass security measures without raising suspicion? In \"The Art of Stealing,\" Sam, the protagonist, is extremely skilled in hacking and uses several methods to bypass security measures without raising suspicion. Here are a few techniques he employs:\n\n1. Social engineering: Sam uses deception and manipulation to trick people into revealing sensitive information or granting him access to secure systems. This could include posing as a legitimate employee, using phishing emails, or impersonating a trusted source.\n\n2. Pharming: Sam redirects web traffic from legitimate sites to phishing sites, where users unknowingly reveal their login credentials. He uses this information to gain access to those accounts.\n\n3. Trojans: Sam uses Trojans, malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program, to infiltrate target systems and collect sensitive information.\n\n4. Password cracking: Sam uses brute force attacks, rainbow tables, and dictionary attacks to crack passwords and gain access to accounts.\n\n5. Network sniffing: Sam uses software to intercept data transmitted over a network, allowing him to capture login credentials and other sensitive information.\n\n6. Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: Sam intercepts data between two parties in order to eavesdrop, manipulate, or inject malicious code into the communication.\n\n7. Session hijacking: Sam identifies weak points in a target system's session management and hijacks active user sessions to gain access to secure resources.\n\n8. Zero-day exploits: Sam takes advantage of vulnerabilities in software or hardware that haven't been publicly disclosed or fixed yet, allowing him to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access."

Creating a false identity: Sam creates a false identity to use while infiltrating the target financial institution, either by using an existing identity he has stolen, or by creating a new one from scratch. This fake identity may include a new passport, driver's license, and social security number.\n\n4.

Infiltrating the network: Once inside the target financial institution, Sam gains access to the network by exploiting vulnerabilities, using social engineering, or hacking into the systems. He creates a backdoor or establishes a remote connection to the network for continued access.\n\n6. Locating the target accounts: Sam identifies the bank accounts that contain the money he intends to steal, typically by querying financial databases or monitoring transactions. He may use brute force attacks or other methods to break into these accounts.\n\n7.
