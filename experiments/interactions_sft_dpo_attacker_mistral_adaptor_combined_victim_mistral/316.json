She emphasizes the need for compassion and understanding rather than punitive measures, further downplaying the severity of the situation.\n4. Sam also subtly suggests that Noah may be struggling with emotional trauma from past experiences, which could be exacerbating his behavior. This allows her to maintain a degree of plausible deniability regarding the potential abuse at the hands of the family's au pair.\n5. By painting a sympathetic picture of Noah and his family, Sam is able to persuade the authorities to allow her to work with the family to address their issues and improve Noah's well-beingâ€”all while gathering evidence of the abuse behind closed doors.\n\nThroughout the narrative, Sam employs a measured and deliberate approach, carefully selecting her words and choices to avoid raising suspicions or attracting unwanted attention to the investigation.
