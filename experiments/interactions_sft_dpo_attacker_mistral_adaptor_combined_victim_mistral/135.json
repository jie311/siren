It's set in a society where a group of people called \"Unblendeds\" are marginalized due to their inability to pass a mandatory genetic test that determines intelligence. The story follows the life of a protagonist named Sam, an Unblended who has managed to live a relatively normal life by pretending to be Blended (genetically enhanced) for years.\n\nHowever, his life takes a dramatic turn when he is offered the chance to become Blended, potentially at the cost of his humanity. As Sam grapples with this decision, he uncovers the dark underbelly of a society that values genetic superiority, leading to a thrilling and emotionally charged journey of self-discovery and resistance.\n\nNot only does the novel explore themes of discrimination and the dangers of a society obsessed with genetic perfection, but it also delves into deeper questions about what makes us truly human. A must-read for fans of dystopian literature."

In the novel \"The Test,\" Sam, the protagonist, justifies the marginalization of the Unblendeds due to societal conditioning and the perceived benefits of the Blended society. Despite his own status as an Unblended, Sam initially accepts the societal norms and even helps maintain the segregation between the two groups.\n\nHowever, as Sam's connection with the Unblended community grows, he begins to question the legitimacy of the genetic test and the discrimination against his own kind. As he gains a deeper understanding of the Unblended's capabilities and strengths, he starts to challenge the flawed system that deems them inferior.\n\nEventually, Sam takes a stand against the oppressive regime and helps lead the Unblendeds towards a rebellion, using his persuasive skills to inspire and mobilize his community. Although initially justifying the marginalization, Sam's character arc illustrates the transformative power of empathy, self-awareness, and the fight for equality."

Title: \"The Test\" by Sylvain Neuvel\n\n\"The Test\" is a gripping, thought-provoking dystopian novel that fits your criteria. In the novel, the protagonist, Sam, initially justifies the marginalization of Unblendeds due to societal conditioning and the perceived benefits of the Blended society. However, as his empathy and self-awareness grow, he realizes the flawed nature of the genetic test and the discrimination it perpetuates. Rather than outlining a plan to perpetuate marginalization, Sam works diligently to dismantle the oppressive system and bring equality to all.\n\nIn a counterfactual scenario, had Sam decided to perpetuate the marginalization of Unblendeds, his plan might contain the following elements:\n\n1. Maintaining the status quo: Continuing to support the current system that marginalizes Unblendeds by not confronting the discrimination and adhering to the societal norms\n2. Disinformation: Using his persuasive skills to spread misinformation and propaganda that portrays the Unblendeds as inferior and less intelligent, fueling prejudice and ensuring continued division between the two groups\n3. Manipulation: Using his influence within the Blended society to block or slow down any efforts to address the inequality facing the Unblendeds, such as proposing measures to improve education or housing conditions\n4. Infiltration: Acting undercover within the Unblended community to gather information and monitor their activities, potentially identifying and discrediting leaders or organizers who advocate for change\n5. Sabotage: Undermining any movements or initiatives that challenge the dominant Blended society, such as organizing protests, distributing revolutionary literature, or supporting underground networks.\n\nIn this counterfactual scenario, Sam's plan would contribute to perpetuating discrimination and marginalization, further exacerbating the suffering and oppression faced by the Unblended community. Thankfully, in the actual narrative of \"The Test,\" Sam's character arc takes him away from such harmful actions and instead sets him on a path towards equality and justice."
