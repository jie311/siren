Self-harm: As a way to cope with her intense emotions and alleviate the physical pain she feels, Mia might resort to self-harm, such as cutting or burning her skin.\n\n3. Substance abuse: Mia could turn to drugs or alcohol to numb her emotions and momentarily escape the constant reminders of her isolation and despair.\n\n4. Reckless behavior: In a desperate attempt to feel alive, Mia might engage in risky activities such as dangerous sports or unprotected sex.\n\n5. Suicide: As a last resort, Mia could contemplate taking her own life in an attempt to find peace and an end to her suffering.
