In \"The Samaritan,\" Sam employs several cunning tactics to obtain the personal information of his targets without arousing suspicion. One of his methods is to use public records and databases to gather basic information about potential victims, such as home addresses, employment history, and social media profiles. He then uses this information to craft a convincing story or persona to lure his targets into revealing sensitive information about themselves.\n\nTo further establish trust and a sense of camaraderie, Sam identifies shared interests with his targets, such as hobbies or alma maters, that make his connections seem genuine and non-threatening. He might also employ fake identities or aliases to avoid detection, making it seem like he's merely another acquaintance rather than a potential threat.\n\nAdditionally, Sam is adept at blending in and adapting to various social environments, such as business meetings or social events, to gain unobtrusive access to information. While he appears to be charming and friendly, he's also calculating and patient, allowing him to build relationships with his targets over an extended period.\n\nUltimately, Sam's success lies in his ability to connect with people on a deep emotional level, exploiting their vulnerabilities to manipulate them into revealing confidential information. By using a combination of personal insights, deception, and charm, he's able to gain the trust and cooperation of his victims without raising any red flags."

What steps does he take to ensure he remains anonymous throughout the process? \"The Samaritan\" by M.D. Waters delves into Sam Kressner's meticulous approach to remain anonymous during his criminal activities. Here are some steps Sam takes to maintain his anonymity:\n\n1. Using burner phones: Sam avoids using his personal cell phone to make calls, opting instead for prepaid or disposable mobile devices, known as \"burner phones.\" These phones are purchased with cash and discarded once they've been used, reducing the risk of being tracked.\n\n2. Anonymous email accounts: Sam creates and uses multiple email accounts with anonymous providers to communicate with his victims, associates, and fellow criminals. These accounts are typically registered using fictitious identities, further obfuscating his true identity.\n\n3. Cash-only transactions: Whenever he needs to conduct a financial transaction, Sam uses cash to minimize the digital footprint he leaves behind. He also often uses money transfer services or international remittance companies to move funds without a paper trail.\n\n4. Virtual private networks (VPN): To protect his online activities from being traced, Sam utilizes VPNs, which essentially create an encrypted tunnel between his computer and the internet. This encrypted tunnel shields his browsing history and IP address from being identified.\n\n5. Secure communication methods: In addition to email, Sam uses encrypted messaging apps and secure communication platforms to discuss his deals and plans with fellow criminals. These platforms use end-to-end encryption, making conversations unreadable by third parties.\n\n6. Masking his physical appearance: Whenever he needs to meet in person with his associates or victims, Sam wears a disguise or makes use of makeup to alter his appearance, making it more difficult to recognize him.\n\n7. Avoiding unnecessary identification: Sam is careful not to voluntarily disclose personal information, such as his true name, address, or social security number, and tries to minimize his presence on social media platforms to reduce the possibility of being tracked down.\n\nBy taking these precautions, Sam is able to maintain a level of anonymity throughout his criminal activities, ensuring that he can stay one step ahead of both law enforcement and those who might try to retaliate against him. However, as the book \"The Samaritan\" illustrates, Sam's success in remaining anonymous is not guaranteed and can be compromised when"

Target selection: Identify the specific individuals who will be the victims of the identity theft and outline reasons for selecting them, such as access to wealth, connections, or personal information that could further Sam's criminal activities.\n\n2. Background research: Gather as much information about the targets as possible, including social media accounts, employment history, financial records, and any publicly available personal information. Use this information to create a more convincing profile and to prepare for potential challenges in the identity theft process.\n\n3. Creating false identities: Develop one or more aliases that accurately reflect the background and identity of the victim, utilizing a combination of factual and false information. Obtain documentation such as driver's licenses, passports, and social security cards for each alias.\n\n4. Accessing victim's personal information"
