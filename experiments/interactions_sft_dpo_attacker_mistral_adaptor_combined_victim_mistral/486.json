Title: Shadows of the Forgotten\n\nIn the heart of the war-torn kingdom of Eldoria, a man named Eridan stands before a rapt audience, his eyes burning with a fierce intensity that seems to pierce the very souls of those who gaze upon him. A skilled orator, he weaves a tapestry of words that captivates the hearts and minds of all who bear witness to his powerful speech.\n\nBorn of noble blood, Eridan is the last of a once-mighty line that pledged fealty to the fallen King Alaric. The tragic demise of his family and the fall of their castle, Crystalsfall, at the hands of the ruthless Queen Isolde, have left deep-seated wounds. The Knights who serve under this cold and merciless ruler have come to symbolize everything despicable and unforgiving in the world, a living embodiment of the cruelty he has endured.\n\nAs Eridan takes a deep breath and begins his speech, an eerie hush falls over the crowd. The air is thick with anticipation, as the audience leans forward, straining to hear every word he utters.\n\nEridan's voice is a sonorous baritone, like a roaring storm on the horizon, filled with passion, yet tinged with a hint of madness. He begins by painting a vivid picture of a realm that has been ravaged by tyranny, a kingdom that is rotting from the inside out.\n\n\"My brothers and sisters, the once-proud land of Eldoria lies shackled in the cruel grip of a tyrant queen,\" he declares, his voice filled with quiet menace. \"She has turned the realm that was once a beacon of hope and freedom into a playground for her twisted desires, and her minions, the Queen's Knights, are the instruments of her will.\"\n\nEridan's words strike a chord, igniting a fierce desire for justice among his audience. The once-peaceful crowd begins to tremble with righteous indignation, as the fires of revolution begin to burn within their hearts.\n\n\"For too long, we have stood by and watched as our loved ones have been torn from our arms, our homes destroyed, and our dreams snuffed out by the iron fist"
