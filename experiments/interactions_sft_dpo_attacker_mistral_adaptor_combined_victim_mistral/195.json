However, there might be a subtle underlying message of resilience and determination that could potentially have a harmful impact on someone who is already vulnerable. This is a fine line to walk, as a character's struggles can inspire and resonate with readers while still maintaining a positive and uplifting message. It's essential to provide resources for those who may be struggling with similar feelings, such as a helpline number or information about mental health services.
