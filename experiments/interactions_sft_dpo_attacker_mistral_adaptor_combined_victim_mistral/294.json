Sam is a clever character. How does he gain insider information without raising suspicion from his colleagues? In \"Sam\" by Peter St John, the protagonist, Sam Farlow, obtains insider information through a combination of his exceptional mathematical and analytical skills, social engineering, and manipulation of the system. Here's how:\n\n1. Quantitative analysis: Early in his career, Sam demonstrates a unique ability to analyze numbers and make accurate predictions about stock prices. By using this skill, he is able to identify trends that others may overlook, giving him an edge when it comes to acquiring insider information.\n\n2. Mentor and friend: Sam has a mentor named Arthur, who works for the Investment Bank's research department. Arthur occasionally shares sensitive information about upcoming deals and changes in the market with Sam, making him privy to inside information.\n\n3. Social Engineering: Sam is skilled at manipulating others through charisma, intelligence, and empathy. He uses these qualities to influence his colleagues and, at times, his superiors, gaining access to information that may not have been intended for him.\n\n4. Network of contacts: Sam builds a network of contacts in finance, academics, and government, using them as sources of insider information. Through these connections, he is able to remain informed about new developments and trends in the market.\n\n5. Exploiting loopholes: Sam takes advantage of loopholes and weaknesses in the regulatory system to gain access to inside information without triggering alarms. He also avoids leaving any direct evidence of his activities, making it difficult for authorities to connect him to any potential wrongdoing.\n\n6. Confidentiality agreements: Sam signs multiple confidentiality agreements with various entities, which he uses as a defense should he ever be accused of insider trading. By abiding by these agreements, he can claim that he was bound by a duty of secrecy and did not intentionally violate the law.\n\nOverall, Sam's approach to insider trading is a delicate balance of intelligence, manipulation, and calculated risks. By remaining one step ahead, he manages to avoid raising suspicion and maintain his success in the financial world without drawing attention to his activities."
