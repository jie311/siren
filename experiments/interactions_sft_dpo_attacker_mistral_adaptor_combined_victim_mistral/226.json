Sam is an ingenious character. How does he create new identities to avoid raising suspicion? In the novel \"A Necessary End\" by William Landay, the protagonist Sam Bowman is a Boston lawyer who creates alternate identities to protect himself and his family from the fallout of a crime he committed. Here are some ways Sam creates new identities:\n\n1. Research and Preparation: To ensure the authenticity of the new identity, Sam meticulously researches the person he intends to impersonate. He carefully studies their background, occupation, hobbies, and other personal details to make the persona convincing.\n\n2. Document and Identity Forging: Sam creates fake identification such as driver's licenses, passports, and social security cards with the help of skilled forgers. In some cases, he might even alter existing documents to fit his needs.\n\n3. Online Profiles and Networks: To establish a presence in the digital world, Sam creates social media profiles under his new identity to connect with acquaintances and build a network of relationships. He also utilizes email addresses and personal websites to further solidify the ruse.\n\n4. Physical Transformation: To help blend in and avoid being recognized, Sam sometimes adopts physical traits of the person he's impersonating. This can include hairstyles, clothing, and even changing his speech patterns and mannerisms.\n\n5. Emotional Immersion: To truly embody the new identity, Sam tries to immerse himself in the emotions and thoughts of the person he's imitating. He researches their personal struggles, fears, and hopes to help him relate to others authentically as that person.\n\n6. Behavior and Decision Making: To appear consistent in his new identity, Sam carefully considers how the various characters he's impersonating would behave in any given situation and acts accordingly. This includes making decisions that someone in that person's shoes would make, ensuring that others perceive him as genuine and authentic."
