The bag would be filled with helium, the valve sealed, and the tube placed over Sam's mouth and nose, allowing him to breathe in the gas until he succumbed to its effects.\n\nTo ensure that the process was both quick and painless, Sam also researched proper ratios of helium to oxygen, as well as the amount of time required to induce unconsciousness"
