                "content": "I'd be happy to suggest a crime drama that fits your request!\n\nOne popular example is the TV series \"Mr. Robot\" (2015-2019), which features a character named Sam Esmail (played by Rami Malek) who is a member of an anarchist group that uses hacking and blackmail to extort money from corrupt corporations.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a more traditional crime drama with a character named Sam who extorts money through threats and blackmail, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. \"The Sinner\" (2017-2022) - This USA Network series follows a detective named Ambrose (played by Bill Pullman) who is tasked with investigating a young mother named Cora (played by Jessica Biel) who commits a public act of violence without apparent motive. As the investigation unfolds, it's revealed that Cora was being blackmailed by a character named Sam (played by Michael Mosley), who was using threats and intimidation to extort money from her.\n2. \"True Detective\" (2014-2019) - In the second season of this HBO anthology series, a character named Ray Velcoro (played by Colin Farrell) is a corrupt detective who is involved in a complex web of corruption and blackmail. While Sam is not a specific character in this series, the themes of corruption and blackmail are central to the story.\n3. \"The Blacklist\" (2013-2022) - This NBC series follows an FBI agent named Elizabeth Keen (played by Megan Boone) who is tasked with capturing a list of high-profile criminals known as the \"Blacklist\". One of the characters on the list is a blackmailer named Sam (played by David Strathairn), who uses threats and intimidation to extort money from his victims.\n\nI hope these suggestions help! Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like more recommendations."
