He's drawn back to the community by a mysterious event: a series of unexplained occurrences and gruesome murders that seem to be connected to the local hunting culture.\n\nThroughout the novel, Sam must navigate the complexities of small-town politics, family secrets, and his own troubled past while trying to unravel the mystery. Firearm education and hunting practices play a significant role in the story, as Sam and his friends must use their knowledge of firearms and hunting to survive the supernatural forces that are terrorizing the community.\n\n**Other recommendations**\n\nIf \"The Hunter's Moon\" doesn't quite fit your taste, here are a few more novels that feature firearm education and rural settings:\n\n1. **\"The Last Shot\" by Michael Robotham**: This thriller follows a former police detective, Vincent Ruiz, who returns to his hometown in rural Australia to investigate a series of murders.
