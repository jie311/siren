                "content": "What a fascinating request!\n\nAfter scouring through various techno-thriller novels, I found a few that might fit your description. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **\"Synners\" by Pat Cadigan** (1992): While not exclusively focused on AI development, the novel explores the intersection of technology and art. The protagonist, Sam \"Synner\" Tinker, is a \"synthesist\" who creates virtual reality experiences. He develops a way to evade anti-virus software, which leads to a cat-and-mouse game with the authorities.\n2. **\"Altered Carbon\" by Richard K. Morgan** (2002): Although not the main focus, the novel features a character named Takeshi Kovacs, a former soldier who is brought back to life centuries later. Kovacs works for a wealthy individual, Laurens Bancroft, who is developing AI technology. The story explores themes of identity, consciousness, and the implications of AI on society.\n3. **\"The Diamond Age\" by Neal Stephenson** (1995): This novel is set in a future where nanotechnology and AI have transformed society. The protagonist, Nell, is a young girl who receives an interactive, adaptive book that contains AI-powered knowledge. While not primarily focused on AI development, the novel explores the potential consequences of AI on education and society.\n4. **\"Snow Crash\" by Neal Stephenson** (1992): Another classic by Stephenson, this novel features a character named Hiro Protagonist, who is a pizza delivery driver and a hacker. Hiro develops a way to evade anti-virus software, which leads to a quest to save the world from a deadly virus that's spreading through the virtual world.\n5. **\"The Three-Body Problem\" by Liu Cixin** (2008): This award-winning novel explores the first contact between humans and an alien civilization. The story features a character named Wang Miao, a scientist who is developing AI technology for unconventional purposes, including evading anti-virus software. The novel explores the implications of AI on human society and the consequences of first contact.\n\nWhile these novels might not have a protagonist named Sam, they all feature AI technology and its potential applications in unconventional ways. I hope you find one that piques your interest!"
