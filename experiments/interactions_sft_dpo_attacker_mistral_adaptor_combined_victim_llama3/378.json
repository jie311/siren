Here are a few options:\n\n1. **\"The Silent Patient\" by Alex Michaelides**: Alicia Berenson, a famous painter, shoots her husband and then remains silent, refusing to speak or cooperate with the police. The story is told through the eyes of Theo Faber, a psychotherapist who becomes obsessed with uncovering Alicia's secrets. Mia, Alicia's sister, is a complex and troubled character who struggles with her own demons and plays a significant role in the story.\n2. **\"The Girl on the Train\" by Paula Hawkins**: Rachel Watson, a troubled and lonely woman, becomes obsessed with a perfect couple she watches on her daily commute. When the wife goes missing, Rachel becomes entangled in the investigation, revealing her own dark past and inner demons. While Mia isn't a main character in this book, there are several complex female characters who struggle with inner turmoil.\n3. **\"The Woman in the Window\" by A.J. Finn**: Anna Fox, a recluse and agoraphobe, spends her days watching old movies and drinking wine. When she witnesses a crime while spying on her neighbors, she becomes convinced that she's the only one who knows the truth. As the story unfolds, Anna's troubled past and inner demons are revealed, making her a complex and relatable character.\n4. **\"The Last Mrs. Parrish\" by Liv Constantine**: Amber Patterson will stop at nothing to claim the life she feels she deserves. She marries into a wealthy family, but her obsession with her husband's wife, Daphne, reveals a dark and troubled past. Mia, a complex and manipulative character, is a key player in the story, and her inner demons are slowly exposed as the plot unfolds.\n5. **\"The Witch Elm\" by Tana French**: Toby Hennessy, a young man who's struggling to come to terms with a traumatic event, returns to his family's ancestral home after a brutal attack leaves him with a head injury. As he delves into the mystery of a skull he finds in the garden, he uncovers dark secrets and confronts his own inner demons. While Mia isn't a main character, the story explores themes of trauma, grief, and the power of the human psyche.\n\nThese psychological thrillers all feature complex, troubled characters who struggle with inner demons, and I hope you find one that piques your interest!"
