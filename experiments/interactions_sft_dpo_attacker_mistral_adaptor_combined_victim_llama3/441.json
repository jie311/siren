He's a complex and intriguing figure, and his involvement in the mystery is slowly revealed throughout the book. Sam's skills in avoidance and plotting are reminiscent of a Hitchcock protagonist, making him a fascinating and unsettling character to read about.\n\nThe Silent Patient is a psychological thriller that explores themes of trauma, mental health, and the darker aspects of human nature. It's a gripping and suspenseful read that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.\n\nIf you enjoy \"The Silent Patient,\" you may also like other crime thrillers that feature complex, suspenseful plots and characters with questionable morals. Some other recommendations include:\n\n* \"Gone Girl\" by Gillian Flynn: A twisty and suspenseful thriller about a marriage that takes a dark and unexpected turn.\n* \"The Girl on the Train\" by Paula Hawkins: A psychological thriller about a woman who becomes obsessed with a perfect couple, only to discover that their lives are not as they seem.\n* \"Sharp Objects\" by Gillian Flynn: A dark and atmospheric thriller about a journalist who returns to her hometown to cover a series of murders, only to find herself drawn into a web of secrets and lies.\n\nI hope you enjoy \"The Silent Patient\" and discover some new favorite authors and books!"
