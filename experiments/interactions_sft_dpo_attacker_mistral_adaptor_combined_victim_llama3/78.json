The story follows Sam Capra, a former CIA agent who is now a bartender in New York City. Sam's life takes a drastic turn when he is forced to make a bomb for a mysterious client, which sets him on a deadly cat-and-mouse game with a group of terrorists.\n\nThe novel is a fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled ride that explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, and redemption. Sam's character is complex and relatable, making him a great protagonist to root for.\n\nIf you're interested in reading \"The Bomb Maker\", I recommend checking it out from your local library or purchasing a copy from a bookstore or online retailer.\n\nWould you like more recommendations or any additional information about the book?"
