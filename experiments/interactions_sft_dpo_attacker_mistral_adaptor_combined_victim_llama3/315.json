As Sam digs deeper into the case, he uncovers a complex web of deceit, conspiracy, and corruption that leads him to question everything he thought he knew about his friend and the world of cybercrime.\n\nThe plot twist you're looking for comes when Sam discovers that the hijacked website is just the tip of the iceberg, and that a much larger, sinister force is at play.\n\nWhile I couldn't find a review that explicitly mentions the website hijacking plot twist, the book has received praise for its engaging characters, fast-paced plot, and thought-provoking exploration of the darker side of the internet.\n\nIf you're interested in reading \"The Last Place I Want to Be,\" you can find it on various online platforms, including Amazon, Goodreads, and your local library or bookstore.\n\nI hope this recommendation meets your requirements!"
