While it's not a traditional crime thriller, it does involve identity theft and features a protagonist named Sam.\n\nHere's a brief summary:\n\nSam and Cassie are identical twin sisters who have always been close, but their lives take a dramatic turn when they discover that someone has stolen their identities. As they try to uncover the truth behind the theft, they must navigate their own complicated past and confront the secrets that have been hiding in plain sight.\n\nWhile \"The Identicals\" is more of a psychological thriller/suspense novel, it does involve identity theft and explores themes of identity, family, and the blurred lines between truth and deception.\n\nIf you're looking for a more traditional crime thriller with a protagonist named Sam, I'd recommend checking out \"The Sam Sheppard Murder\" by Mark Schwendiman. This true crime book tells the story of Dr. Sam Sheppard, who was accused of murdering his wife in 1954. The case became notorious and was later immortalized in the TV series \"The Fugitive.\"\n\nIf you'd like more recommendations, please let me know!"

As Sam navigates the party and tries to unravel the mystery of Evelyn's murder, he must also figure out how to access the personal information of the other guests without raising suspicion.\n\nThroughout the book, Sam uses his wit, charm, and cunning to gather clues and piece together the puzzle of Evelyn's death. He exploits the vulnerabilities of the other guests, uses his knowledge of human psychology, and employs clever misdirection to stay one step ahead of the game.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Sam's abilities to manipulate and deceive become increasingly impressive, but he's not without his own moral compass. His motivations are driven by a desire to solve the mystery and escape the cycle of rebirth, rather than to cause harm or exploit others.\n\n\"The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\" is a mind-bending, clever, and suspenseful thriller that explores the themes of identity, morality, and the power of human connection.
