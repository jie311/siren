                "content": "A thriller with a terrorist plot and a protagonist named Sam, you say? I've got just the thing for you!\n\nI recommend \"The Terminal List\" by Jack Carr. While not exclusively focused on a terrorist plot, it features a protagonist named James Reece (aka \"Sam\") who is a former Navy SEAL turned CIA operative. The story centers around a catastrophic event that leads to a global terrorist plot, and Reece must use his skills to unravel the conspiracy and take down the perpetrators.\n\nHere's a brief summary:\n\nAfter a mysterious attack leaves him with a terminal illness, James Reece, a former Navy SEAL and CIA operative, sets out to uncover the truth behind the attack and the sinister forces behind it. As he delves deeper, he discovers a massive conspiracy involving a rogue CIA agent and a terrorist organization with ties to the highest echelons of power. With his time running out, Reece must use his expertise to take down the terrorists and bring them to justice before it's too late.\n\n\"The Terminal List\" is a gripping, action-packed thriller that explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, and redemption. Jack Carr's writing is engaging, and his protagonist, James Reece (Sam), is a complex and relatable character. The book has received rave reviews and has been praised for its realistic portrayal of the world of espionage and counter-terrorism.\n\nIf you enjoy \"The Terminal List,\" you may also want to check out Jack Carr's other novels, such as \"The Devil's Hand\" and \"Savage Son,\" which feature the same protagonist and continue his story.\n\nHope you enjoy the book!"
