As a young journalist, she had dreamed of making a name for herself in the competitive world of news reporting. She had worked her way up the ranks, from small-town newspapers to larger metropolitan dailies, earning a reputation for her sharp instincts and keen storytelling abilities.\n\nBut when she landed a job at the prestigious New York Times, Sam felt like she had finally made it.
