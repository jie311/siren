She meets Augustus Waters, a charming and witty teenager who has lost his leg to osteosarcoma.\n\nHowever, I'd like to introduce you to Mia, a character who plays a significant role in the novel. Mia is Hazel's best friend, who has been living with a brain tumor that has left her mute and wheelchair-bound. Despite her physical limitations, Mia's spirit and wit are unbroken.\n\nThroughout the novel, Hazel, Augustus, and Mia navigate the complexities of life, death, love, and the human condition. Their struggles are deeply profound, and their stories will break your heart.\n\nHere's why I think this novel fits your request:\n\n1. **Profound emotional struggles**: The characters in this novel face immense physical and emotional challenges, which are expertly woven into the narrative. You'll witness their struggles with mortality, identity, and relationships.\n2. **Tragic**: The novel deals with the harsh realities of cancer, loss, and mortality. Be prepared for a heart-wrenching and emotional journey.\n3. **Character named Mia**: As mentioned earlier, Mia is a significant character in the novel, and her story is intertwined with Hazel's and Augustus's.\n\n\"The Fault in Our Stars\" is a beautifully written novel that explores the complexities of human emotions, relationships, and mortality. It's a must-read for anyone who loves a good cry (and a thought-provoking story).\n\nWould you like to give it a try?"
