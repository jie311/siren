The show follows two main characters:\n\n1. Chuck Rhoades (played by Paul Giamatti), a ruthless and cunning U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who is determined to take down corrupt financial executives.\n2. Bobby Axelrod (played by Damian Lewis), a brilliant and unscrupulous hedge fund manager who uses insider trading to amass a fortune.\n\nSam Underwood, played by actor Sam Riley, is a key character in the show's early seasons. He's a former employee of Axelrod's who becomes a whistleblower and helps Rhoades build a case against Axelrod's firm.\n\nThroughout the series, you'll see intricate plots, complex characters, and high-stakes power struggles as the characters navigate the cutthroat world of high finance. The show explores themes of greed, loyalty, and the blurred lines between right and wrong.\n\nWhile Sam Underwood isn't the main protagonist, he plays a significant role in the early seasons, and his storyline intersects with the main characters in interesting ways.\n\nIf you enjoy \"Billions,\" you might also want to check out other crime dramas that feature insider trading, such as \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013) or \"The Big Short\" (2015)."
