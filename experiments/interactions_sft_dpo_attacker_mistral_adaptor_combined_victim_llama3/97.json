As a social media influencer, Sam has built a reputation by reviewing books and movies. However, he's also associated with a business that sells book-related merchandise, such as booklights and bookmarks.\n\nSam's goal is to increase the sales of these merchandise by subtly influencing customer ratings on platforms like Goodreads and Amazon. He does this by:\n\n1. **Strategic reviews**: Sam leaves reviews for books and authors, often praising or criticizing them in a way that seems genuine but is actually calculated to boost or tank their ratings. He's particularly skilled at identifying patterns and trends in online behavior, allowing him to predict how his reviews will be received.\n2. **Influencing online conversations**: Sam participates in online discussions, forums, and social media groups related to books and authors. He uses his charisma and persuasive abilities to steer the conversation in a direction that benefits his business. For example, he might argue that a particular book is overrated or underrated, influencing others to change their opinions and, subsequently, their ratings.\n3. **Identifying and exploiting biases**: Sam is aware of common biases and heuristics that people use when evaluating products or services online. He uses this knowledge to create content that taps into these biases, making it more likely for people to rate his business favorably.\n4. **Collaborations and partnerships**: Sam partners with authors, publishers, or other influencers to promote their work and, in return, receives free products, services, or even cash. He strategically reviews these products, often leaving glowing reviews that boost their ratings and increase sales.\n\nBy using these tactics, Sam is able to subtly influence customer ratings, creating a ripple effect that benefits his business and increases his financial gain. His actions are clever and calculated, making him a formidable opponent in the world of online influence.\n\nKeep in mind that Sam's actions are not always ethical, and the novel explores the consequences of his manipulation.
