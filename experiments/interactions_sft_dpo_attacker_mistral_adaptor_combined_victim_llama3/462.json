Manning.\n\nHere's a brief summary:\n\nSam (short for Samantha) is a brilliant and resourceful cybersecurity expert who's been hired by a top-secret government agency to track down a mysterious cyber-terrorist known only as \"The Architect.\" The Architect has created a highly sophisticated malware that can spread rapidly and evade detection, causing chaos and destruction across the globe.\n\nAs Sam delves deeper into the case, she discovers that The Architect's true intentions are far more sinister than just causing mayhem. The malware is designed to manipulate and control critical infrastructure, including power grids, financial systems, and even the internet itself.\n\nSam must use her exceptional skills to stay one step ahead of The Architect and prevent global catastrophe. Along the way, she uncovers a web of deceit and corruption that threatens to destroy everything she holds dear.\n\n\"The Trust\" is a gripping cyber-thriller that explores the darker side of technology and the consequences of playing with fire in the digital world. If you enjoy fast-paced action, clever hacking, and a strong female protagonist, this book is definitely worth checking out!\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any other questions!"
