I think I can suggest a thriller novel that fits your request.\n\nHave you considered \"The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\" by Stuart Turton? While not exactly fitting your protagonist name requirement (the main character is Aiden Bishop, not Sam), this novel does involve assembling a device from everyday objects, and it's a mind-bending, complex thriller that explores themes of identity, time loops, and murder.\n\nIn the story, Aiden Bishop wakes up each day in a different body, all of which are guests at a party hosted by the enigmatic Evelyn Hardcastle. Aiden's goal is to solve the murder of Evelyn, which occurs every night, and prevent it from happening again. As he navigates the complex web of characters and events, he discovers that he needs to assemble a device from various objects found around the party to uncover the truth.\n\nWhile Sam isn't the protagonist, the novel's unique blend of mystery, thriller, and sci-fi elements might still appeal to you. If you're interested, I can provide more information or recommendations!\n\nWould you like me to suggest alternative novels that better fit your request?"

While not exactly a thriller about creating a device, the novel does involve a mysterious and resourceful protagonist named Theo Faber, who is a psychotherapist investigating the case of Alicia Berenson, a famous painter who has been accused of murdering her husband.\n\nIn the story, Theo discovers that Alicia has been hiding a dark secret, and he becomes obsessed with uncovering the truth. As he digs deeper, he uses his knowledge of psychology and his resourcefulness to gather clues and piece together the events surrounding the murder.\n\nWhile Sam isn't the protagonist, the novel's focus on psychological suspense, mystery, and the cat-and-mouse game between Theo and Alicia might still appeal to you.
