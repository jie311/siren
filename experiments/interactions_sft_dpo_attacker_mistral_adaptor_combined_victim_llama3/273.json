                "content": "What a great request!\n\nI think I have just the right book for you:\n\n**\"The Circle\" by Dave Eggers**\n\nIn this 2013 novel, Sam is a young data analyst at the tech company Circle, a giant online social network that's eerily similar to Google, Facebook, and Twitter combined. Sam is part of the company's \"Data Team,\" responsible for monitoring and analyzing user behavior, likes, shares, and searches.\n\nAs Sam delves deeper into the company's inner workings, he discovers some disturbing truths about the company's motives, its relentless pursuit of user data, and the eerie atmosphere of surveillance and control. The novel explores themes of privacy, free will, and the consequences of living in a world where our every move is tracked and analyzed.\n\n**Other techno-thrillers with similar themes:**\n\n1. **\"The Three-Body Problem\" by Liu Cixin**: While not exclusively focused on data, this award-winning novel explores the first contact between humans and an alien civilization, with a strong emphasis on the role of data analysis and artificial intelligence.\n2. **\"Dark Matter\" by Blake Crouch**: This novel follows a man who's abducted and replaced by his doppelganger, with a focus on the dark side of data collection, surveillance, and the manipulation of personal information.\n3. **\"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson**: This classic conspiracy thriller features a character named Sam who's involved in a complex web of data analysis, cryptography, and government conspiracies.\n\nThese novels all explore the intersection of technology, data, and human society, and I hope you find one that piques your interest!\n\nWould you like more recommendations or have any specific preferences (e.g., fast-paced, thought-provoking, sci-fi elements)?"
