While it doesn't exactly feature a character developing a password-cracking algorithm, it does involve cryptography and coding.\n\nIn \"The Cipher,\" FBI agent Rachel Marin is tasked with solving a series of murders where the killer leaves behind cryptic messages and codes. As Rachel delves deeper into the case, she teams up with a brilliant cryptographer, Sam (yes, the protagonist's name is Sam!), to crack the codes and uncover the identity of the killer.\n\nWhile the novel doesn't focus specifically on password-cracking, it explores the world of cryptography and coding, which might scratch that itch for you. Plus, the protagonist's name is Sam, which fits your request!\n\nIf you're interested, you can find \"The Cipher\" on various book platforms, including Amazon, Goodreads, and your local library.\n\nIf this isn't exactly what you're looking for, please let me know, and I can try to suggest more options or help you find a similar book!"
