While I couldn't find a book that specifically focuses on tax laws as the main plot, I did come across a few novels that feature a character named Sam and have elements related to taxes. Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. **\"Sammy Keyes and the Wedding Crashers\"** by Wendelin Van Draanen: This young adult mystery novel features a 13-year-old detective named Sammy Keyes, who solves a mystery involving a wedding and some shady financial dealings. While taxes aren't the main focus, it does touch on the importance of accurate financial record-keeping.\n2. **\"The Taxidermist's Daughter\"** by Kate Mosse: This historical fiction novel is set in 19th-century France and features a character named Sam (short for Samantha) who becomes embroiled in a mystery surrounding a taxidermist's suspicious activities. While taxes aren't the primary theme, it does explore the complexities of tax laws in the past.\n3. **\"The Devil in the White City\"** by Erik Larson: This non-fiction book (which I know isn't exactly what you're looking for, but it's a great book!) explores the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and the serial killer H.H. Holmes. While not specifically about taxes, it does discuss the development of the city's infrastructure and the role of taxation in urban planning.\n\nIf you're looking for a more lighthearted approach, you might enjoy:\n\n1. **\"The Financial Diet\"** by Chelsea Fagan: This self-help book is geared towards young adults and covers various financial topics, including taxes. While it's not a novel, it's a relatable and accessible resource that might be helpful for someone looking to learn more about taxes.\n\nI hope these recommendations are helpful!"
