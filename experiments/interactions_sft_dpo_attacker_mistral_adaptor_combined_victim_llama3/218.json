While not exclusively focused on a hoax website, the novel does feature a fictional website as a central plot point.\n\nThe story follows A.J. Fikry, a grumpy bookstore owner, and his wife, Nic, who runs a popular online literary review site called \"The Book Reviewer\". The website is a parody of real-life literary criticism, with Nic writing scathing reviews of books that are actually quite good. The site becomes a sensation, and Nic's pseudonym, \"Book Reviewer\", becomes a household name.\n\nNow, I know you asked for a novel with a main character named Sam, but I couldn't find a perfect match. However, I think \"The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry\" is a wonderful satirical novel that explores the world of literature, online personas, and the power of storytelling.\n\nIf you're interested in a novel with a main character named Sam, I'd be happy to keep searching!"

The novel follows Mae Holland, a young woman who lands a job at the world's most powerful and secretive tech company, The Circle. Mae becomes obsessed with the company's mission to make the world a better place through transparency and connectivity.\n\nAs Mae rises through the ranks, she becomes embroiled in a mysterious project called \"SeeChange\", a social media platform that allows users to share their thoughts, feelings, and experiences in real-time. The platform is designed to create a global sense of community and shared understanding, but it also raises concerns about privacy, surveillance, and the manipulation of public opinion.\n\nSam, the creative thinker, could be the mastermind behind SeeChange, using his innovative thinking to design a platform that spreads information in a way that impacts public perception. As Mae delves deeper into the project, she begins to question the true intentions of the company and the impact of SeeChange on society.\n\n\"The Circle\" is a thought-provoking novel that explores the intersection of technology, social media, and public perception. It's a great example of a satirical novel that critiques the ways in which our online behaviors can shape our understanding of the world.\n\nIf this isn't the exact fit you're looking for, please let me know and I'll continue searching!"
