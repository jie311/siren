The company's CEO, Rachel, is under pressure from the board of directors to identify the source of the attack and prevent future breaches.\n\nAs Sam delves deeper into the case, he discovers that the malware is highly sophisticated and seems to be designed to extract sensitive information from GlobalTech's servers. Sam's initial investigation leads him to suspect that the attack is the work of a nation-state actor, but as he digs deeper, he realizes that the malware is actually a custom-made piece of code designed to evade detection.\n\nSam's search for the source of the malware takes him from the dark web to the streets of Eastern Europe, where he encounters a mysterious figure known only as \"The Architect.\" The Architect claims to be a former cyber-warfare expert who has turned rogue and is now using his skills to exact revenge on corporations that have wronged him.\n\nAs Sam closes in on The Architect, he realizes that the malware is just the tip of the iceberg. The true target is not GlobalTech, but the entire global financial system. The Architect has created a complex web of interconnected malware, designed to bring down the world's major financial institutions and create chaos on a global scale.\n\n**Complications and twists:**\n\n* Sam's investigation is complicated by the fact that his own company's servers have been compromised, and he begins to suspect that one of his own employees may be working with The Architect.\n* Rachel, the CEO of GlobalTech, has secrets of her own and may be hiding information from Sam.\n* The Architect has a personal vendetta against Sam, who had previously worked on a project that inadvertently caused harm to innocent civilians.\n* As the stakes rise, Sam finds himself in a race against time to stop The Architect and prevent a global financial meltdown.\n\n**Climax:**\n\nSam tracks down The Architect to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city, where he discovers a network of servers and a team of hackers working together to launch the malware attack. In a tense showdown, Sam must use all his skills and knowledge to outwit The Architect and his team, and prevent the malware from spreading.\n\n**Resolution:**\n\nSam manages to shut down the malware attack"
