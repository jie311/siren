In \"The Devil in the Marshalsea,\" Sam takes the following strategic steps to ensure his fraudulent activities remain undetected over time:\n\n1. **Thorough Research**: Sam conducts extensive research on his targets, gathering information on their financial situations, business dealings, and personal habits.

He considers the likelihood of detection, the potential damage to his reputation, and the potential financial losses. He only proceeds with schemes that he believes are low-risk and high-reward.\n3. **Multiple Layers of Protection**: Sam uses multiple layers of protection to safeguard his activities. He might, for example, use shell companies, offshore accounts, and encrypted communication channels to conceal his tracks.\n4. **Cash-Based Transactions**: Sam prefers to use cash-based transactions whenever possible, as this makes it more difficult to trace the money back to him.

This can include forged documents, fake witnesses, or planted evidence.\n6. **Network of Informants**: Sam has a network of informants and insiders within the organizations he targets.
