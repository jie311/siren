Here's a summary of \"The Circle\" by Dave Eggers:\n\nIn a not-too-distant future, the world is dominated by a social media platform called The Circle, which has become the primary source of news, entertainment, and social interaction. Sam, a young and ambitious journalist, lands a job at The Circle, determined to make a name for himself in the competitive world of online news.\n\nSam's big break comes when he stumbles upon a mysterious and explosive news item: a video of a young woman, Mae Holland, who has just been hired at The Circle's headquarters, being brutally murdered by a group of masked assailants. The video is shocking, and Sam is convinced that it's a major scoop.\n\nAs Sam digs deeper into the story, he becomes obsessed with uncovering the truth behind Mae's murder. He faces resistance from his colleagues, who are more interested in promoting The Circle's brand than in investigating the murder. Sam's investigation puts him at odds with his colleagues and superiors, who are willing to do whatever it takes to keep the story under wraps.\n\nAs Sam delves deeper into the mystery, he discovers that The Circle is hiding something much bigger than a simple murder. He uncovers a web of deceit, corruption, and conspiracy that threatens the very fabric of society. The more Sam learns, the more he realizes that he is in grave danger, and that The Circle will stop at nothing to silence him.\n\n\"The Circle\" is a thrilling story that explores the darker side of social media and the consequences of unchecked power. Sam's quest for the truth is a gripping and suspenseful ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.\n\nI hope you enjoy the story!"
