Have you considered \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson? While it's not exclusively focused on database hacking, the protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, is a brilliant hacker who helps the main character, Mikael Blomkvist, uncover dark secrets by accessing a company's database.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a more specific recommendation with a character named Sam, I'd like to suggest \"The Circle\" by Dave Eggers. The story takes place in a not-too-distant future where a young woman named Mae Holland starts working for a powerful tech company called The Circle. As Mae becomes more involved with the company, she begins to uncover some disturbing secrets and decides to take matters into her own hands, using her own hacking skills to access the company's database.\n\nAnother option could be \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" by Patricia Highsmith, which doesn't directly involve database hacking but features a character named Tom Ripley who uses his cunning and resourcefulness to manipulate and deceive others, including accessing private information.\n\nIf none of these suggestions appeal to you, please let me know and I can try to provide more recommendations based on your preferences!"

While it's not exclusively focused on database hacking, the protagonist, Cormoran Strike, is a private investigator who hires a tech-savvy assistant, Tom, to help him uncover secrets.\n\nTom, who's a skilled hacker, uses his expertise to access a company's database and uncover information. He does this by exploiting specific vulnerabilities in the system, such as an outdated software version, an unpatched security flaw, or a weak password. He also uses social engineering tactics, like pretending to be a legitimate user or convincing an employee to give him access.\n\nIn the book, Tom's hacking skills are used to uncover a web of deceit and corruption within the company. He uses his knowledge of database systems to identify sensitive information, track user activity, and analyze data patterns.\n\nAnother option could be \"The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\" by Stuart Turton. The story features a unique blend of mystery, thriller, and sci-fi elements. The protagonist, Aiden Bishop, is trapped in a cycle of murder and rebirth, reliving the same day over and over. He uses his knowledge of computer systems to uncover clues and hack into the estate's database to learn more about the murder.\n\nIf neither of these suggestions appeal to you, please let me know and I can try to provide more recommendations based on your preferences!\n\n(Note: Keep in mind that while these books feature hacking and database access, they are works of fiction and should not be taken as a guide for real-world hacking activities. Hacking is illegal and can have serious consequences.)"
