While not strictly a crime novel, it does involve identity theft and features a protagonist named Sam.\n\nThe story follows identical twin sisters Harper and Tabitha, who switch lives for the summer. Harper, a struggling artist, takes on Tabitha's life as a successful businesswoman, while Tabitha becomes Harper's free-spirited sister. However, things take a dark turn when Tabitha's husband, Sam, begins to suspect that his wife is not who she claims to be.\n\nAs Sam digs deeper, he uncovers a web of deceit and identity theft that threatens to destroy his marriage and his life. The novel explores themes of identity, family secrets, and the blurred lines between truth and fiction.\n\nWhile \"The Identicals\" is a women's fiction novel rather than a traditional crime novel, it does involve identity theft and features a protagonist named Sam, making it a great fit for your request.\n\nIf you're looking for a more traditional crime novel with a protagonist named Sam, I'd be happy to provide some alternative recommendations!"
