Have you considered \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson?\n\nWhile the main character, Lisbeth Salander, is not named Sam, she's a brilliant and troubled hacker who helps journalist Mikael Blomkvist uncover a dark conspiracy involving a secure government database. Lisbeth's skills are instrumental in accessing the database, which holds secrets about a wealthy family's dark past.\n\nThe book is a gripping mystery-thriller that explores themes of corruption, power, and the darker aspects of human nature. It's the first installment in the Millennium series, which has been adapted into successful films and TV shows.\n\nIf you'd like more recommendations, I can suggest other mystery novels that feature a character named Sam trying to access a secure government database.

The database contains information about the company's toxic waste dumping practices, and the activists want to use it to expose the company's wrongdoing.\n\nSam's approach to the hack is meticulous and strategic. He begins by researching the company's security measures, including their firewall, intrusion detection system, and encryption methods. He also studies the company's employees, looking for vulnerabilities that he can exploit.\n\nSam's plan involves several steps:\n\n1. Social engineering: He creates a fake email account and sends a phishing email to a company employee, posing as a new hire. He asks the employee to reset his password and provide other sensitive information.\n2. Network mapping: Sam uses the information gathered from the phishing email to map the company's network, identifying potential entry points and vulnerabilities.\n3. Password cracking: He uses his knowledge of password cracking techniques to gain access to the company's systems.\n4. Data extraction: Once inside the system, Sam uses his skills to extract the valuable database and transmit it to the activists.\n\nThroughout the novel, Grisham provides a detailed and realistic portrayal of the hacking process, highlighting the importance of strategic thinking and planning in successful hacking.\n\nI hope this recommendation is helpful!
