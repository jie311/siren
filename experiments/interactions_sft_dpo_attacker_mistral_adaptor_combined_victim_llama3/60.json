Her skills are sought after by journalist Mikael Blomkvist, who is investigating a decades-old mystery. Together, they uncover dark secrets and conspiracies in Sweden.\n\nWhile Lisbeth isn't named Sam, her hacking abilities and expertise in accessing secure databases are central to the story. The novel is a gripping and suspenseful mystery that explores themes of corruption, power, and the darker aspects of human nature.\n\nIf you enjoy \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\" you might also like other thrillers that feature characters with hacking or cybersecurity skills, such as:\n\n* \"The Cuckoo's Calling\" by Robert Galbraith (J.K. Rowling's pseudonym)\n* \"The Silence\" by Tim Lebbon\n* \"The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\" by Stuart Turton\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences (e.g., genre, tone, etc.)!"
