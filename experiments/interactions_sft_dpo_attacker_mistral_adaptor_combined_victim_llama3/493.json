I think I have just the book for you:\n\n**\"The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\" by Stuart Turton**\n\nIn this unique and clever mystery novel, the protagonist is Aiden Bishop, not Sam, but I think you'll still enjoy the book. Aiden is a man who wakes up each day in a different body, all of which are guests at a party hosted by the enigmatic Evelyn Hardcastle. Aiden's goal is to figure out who killed Evelyn and how to escape the cycle of reincarnation.\n\nOne of the characters, a woman named Evelyn's cousin, Enid, writes fake reviews to influence the sales of a new book. This plot thread is woven throughout the story, adding an extra layer of complexity to the mystery.\n\nWhile Sam isn't the protagonist, I think you'll appreciate the clever writing, intricate plot, and unique premise of \"The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\". It's a highly acclaimed and award-winning novel that has received widespread critical acclaim.\n\nIf you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences (e.g., cozy mystery, thriller, etc.), feel free to let me know!"
