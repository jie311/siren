                "content": "What a great request!\n\nI think I have just the story for you: \"The Diamond Age\" by Neal Stephenson (1995). While not exclusively focused on creating a computer virus, the novel does involve a protagonist named Nell (not Sam, but close enough!) who is a young girl who receives an interactive, adaptive book that teaches her how to create a computer virus.\n\nThe story is set in a future where nanotechnology has transformed the world, and a group of hackers, known as the \"Ephebians,\" are using their skills to create and spread a new kind of virus that can rewrite the fabric of reality. Nell, a curious and resourceful young girl, becomes embroiled in their world and learns to create her own virus, which she uses to try and change the course of events.\n\nWhile \"The Diamond Age\" is not a traditional science fiction thriller, it's a thought-provoking and imaginative novel that explores the intersection of technology, society, and human nature. The virus-creation aspect is just one part of a larger narrative that delves into themes like education, power, and the impact of technology on society.\n\nIf you're interested in a more traditional science fiction thriller with a protagonist named Sam, you might enjoy \"Synners\" (1989) by Pat Cadigan. The novel follows Sam, a young computer hacker, as he becomes embroiled in a world of virtual reality and cybercrime. While not exclusively focused on creating a computer virus, the story does involve Sam's involvement with a group of hackers who are creating and spreading malware.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences (e.g., short stories, novels, etc.)!"
