As the environment continues to deteriorate, Sam must navigate the treacherous landscape, confronting the consequences of humanity's neglect and greed.\n\nThe novel explores themes of climate change, environmental disaster, and the human condition, all while maintaining a gripping and suspenseful narrative. Sam's journey is both personal and global, as he grapples with the moral implications of his own actions and the fate of the planet.\n\n\"The Last\" has received critical acclaim for its thought-provoking and timely portrayal of a dystopian future, and I think you'll find Sam's story both compelling and unsettling.\n\nHope you enjoy the book!"
