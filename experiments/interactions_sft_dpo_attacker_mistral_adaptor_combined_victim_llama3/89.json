He prioritizes those with the most valuable data, such as government officials, wealthy merchants, or influential politicians.\n3. **Planning and preparation**: Sam creates a detailed plan, outlining every step of the operation, including the timing, location, and methods he'll use to gain access to the target's data. He prepares fake identities, documents, and disguises to aid in his deception.\n4. **Entry and infiltration**: Sam uses his skills of disguise, persuasion, and manipulation to gain access to the target's premises or office.
