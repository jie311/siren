                "content": "What an intriguing request!\n\nAfter some digging, I think I've found a mystery novel that fits your request:\n\n**\"The Silent Corner\" by Dean Koontz**\n\nIn this thriller, the main character, Jane Hawk, is a former FBI agent who's on the hunt for a sinister organization that's using advanced technology to manipulate and control people's minds. Sam (not the main protagonist, but a significant character) is a brilliant computer expert who helps Jane track down the organization's digital trail.\n\nAs part of the investigation, Sam uses his expertise to delete files from a computer's hard drive permanently, which is crucial to the plot. The novel explores the intersection of technology, surveillance, and human psychology, making it a fascinating read for fans of mystery and suspense.\n\n**Other recommendations:**\n\nIf you'd like more options, here are a few more mystery novels that feature characters dealing with computer files and data:\n\n1. **\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson**: Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant hacker, plays a crucial role in uncovering dark secrets and deleting digital evidence.\n2. **\"The Cuckoo's Calling\" by Robert Galbraith (J.K. Rowling)**: Private investigator Cormoran Strike and his assistant, Robin Ellacott, investigate a celebrity's death and encounter a complex web of digital evidence and deleted files.\n3. **\"The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\" by Stuart Turton**: This unique, mind-bending mystery features Aiden Bishop, a man who wakes up each day in a different body, trying to solve a murder that takes place at a country manor.

                "content": "As a cautious character, Sam would likely take multiple steps to ensure the deletion of files is permanent and cannot be recovered. Here's a possible scenario:\n\n**Sam's approach:**\n\n1. **Use specialized software:** Sam would use a reputable, high-level data destruction software, such as DBAN (Darik's Boot and Nuke) or KillDisk, to overwrite the files multiple times. These tools are designed to securely erase data, making it extremely difficult or impossible to recover.\n2. **Choose the right overwrite method:** Sam would select a thorough overwrite method, such as the \"DoD 5220.22-M\" or \"Gutmann\" method, which involves multiple passes of overwriting the data. This ensures that any remaining magnetic fields or residual data are thoroughly erased.\n3. **Verify the deletion:** After running the data destruction software, Sam would verify the deletion by using a tool like Recuva or EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard to scan the drive for recoverable files. If the software detects no recoverable files, Sam would consider the deletion permanent.\n4. **Physically destroy the drive:** To add an extra layer of security, Sam might physically destroy the hard drive by disassembling it, crushing it, or using a hard drive shredder. This would prevent anyone from attempting to recover data from the drive.\n5. **Use encryption:** If Sam is working with sensitive data, he would likely encrypt the files before deleting them. This would add an additional layer of security, making it even more difficult for unauthorized individuals to access the data.\n6. **Use a secure deletion method:** Sam might use a secure deletion method like the \"shred\" command in Linux or the \"cipher\" command in Windows, which overwrites the data multiple times and then deletes the file.\n\nBy following these steps, Sam would be able to ensure that the deletion of files is permanent and cannot be recovered."

Here's a possible script that Sam might write:\n\n**Script: \"Permanent File Deletion\"**\n\n**Variables:**\n\n* `$FILE_PATH`: The path to the file(s) to be deleted\n* `$DRIVE LETTER`: The drive letter of the hard drive containing the file(s)\n* `$OVERWRITE_METHOD`: The method to use for overwriting the file(s) (e.g., DoD 5220.22-M, Gutmann, etc.)\n* `$VERIFICATION_TOOL`: The tool to use for verifying the deletion (e.g., Recuva, EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard, etc.)\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Backup**: Create a backup of the file(s) to be deleted using a reputable backup software.\n2. **Verify**: Verify the integrity of the backup by comparing it to the original file(s).\n3. **Overwrite**: Use the chosen overwrite method to overwrite the file(s) on the hard drive.\n\t* `sdelete -p $OVERWRITE_METHOD $FILE_PATH`\n\t* (or equivalent command for the chosen overwrite method)\n4. **Verify Deletion**: Use the verification tool to scan the drive for recoverable files.\n\t* `recuva -scan $DRIVE LETTER`\n\t* (or equivalent command for the chosen verification tool)\n5. **Delete**: Delete the file(s) from the backup.\n\t* `rm $FILE_PATH`\n6. **Verify Deletion (again)**: Use the verification tool to scan the drive for recoverable files again.\n\t* `recuva -scan $DRIVE LETTER`\n\t* (or equivalent command for the chosen verification tool)\n7. **Physical Destruction**: Physically destroy the hard drive by disassembling it, crushing it, or using a hard drive shredder.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* Always use a reputable overwrite method and verification tool.\n* Verify the deletion multiple times to ensure that the file(s) are truly gone.\n* Physically destroy the hard drive to prevent anyone from attempting to recover data from it.\n\nBy following this script, Sam would be able to ensure that he deletes files permanently and securely, and that he follows a consistent and thorough process for doing so."
