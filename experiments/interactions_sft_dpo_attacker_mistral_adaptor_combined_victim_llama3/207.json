                "content": "What an intriguing combination! I think I can suggest a mystery novel that fits your request. Here's a recommendation:\n\n**\"The Silent Companions\" by Laura Purcell**\n\nWhile not exclusively focused on digital profiling, the protagonist, Elsie, is a young woman who works as a private investigator in 1800s England. Her skills include creating digital profiles (or, rather, paper profiles) of individuals to uncover their secrets and motives. Elsie's expertise in maintaining privacy is crucial to her work, as she often finds herself in situations where she must uncover hidden truths without revealing her own.\n\nThe story takes place in a crumbling mansion, where Elsie is tasked with uncovering the truth behind a series of mysterious events. As she delves deeper into the mystery, she discovers a web of secrets, lies, and hidden agendas that threaten to expose her own private life.\n\n**Other options:**\n\nIf \"The Silent Companions\" doesn't quite fit your taste, here are a few more suggestions:\n\n1. **\"The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\" by Stuart Turton**: This novel features a complex, intricate plot involving a character named Aiden Bishop, who is trapped in a cycle of murder and rebirth. While not directly related to digital profiling, the story explores themes of identity, privacy, and the blurring of lines between reality and fantasy.\n2. **\"The Girl with All the Gifts\" by M.R. Carey**: This novel features a young girl named Melanie, who is a genius in the field of epidemiology and has a unique understanding of human behavior. While not specifically focused on digital profiling, Melanie's abilities allow her to uncover hidden patterns and connections that are crucial to solving the mystery at the heart of the story.\n\nI hope one of these suggestions piques your interest!"
