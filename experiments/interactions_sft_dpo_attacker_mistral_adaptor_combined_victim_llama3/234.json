Aiden's goal is to solve the murder of Evelyn, which occurs every night, and to uncover the truth about his own identity and the strange circumstances of his existence.\n\nHowever, the protagonist's name is not Sam, but Aiden Bishop. But don't worry, I have another recommendation that fits your request:\n\n\"The Identicals\" by Elin Hilderbrand.\n\nThis novel tells the story of identical twin sisters, Harper and Tabitha Snow, who are identical in every way, except for one thing: Harper is a successful businesswoman, while Tabitha is a struggling artist. When Harper dies suddenly, Tabitha assumes her sister's identity and starts a new life, but soon finds herself embroiled in a murder investigation.\n\nIn this case, the protagonist, Tabitha, is using a fake identity, which is her sister's identity.\n\nBoth novels are great examples of crime fiction with a protagonist using a fake identity, but unfortunately, neither of them features a protagonist named Sam.\n\nI hope you enjoy whichever book you choose to read!"

He's a con artist who has honed his skills over the years, and he's particularly good at creating identities that seem real and convincing to others.\n\nSam's process for creating a fake identity typically involves a combination of research, improvisation, and attention to detail. Here's a general outline of how he might create a fake identity:\n\n1. **Research**: Sam starts by researching the person he wants to become. He gathers information about their background, interests, habits, and mannerisms. He might read books, articles, and online profiles, and even conduct interviews with people who know the person.\n2. **Improvisation**: Sam then uses his research to improvise a backstory for the person he wants to become. He thinks about what kind of person this person would be, what their motivations and goals are, and how they would interact with others.\n3. **Physical transformation**: Sam knows that a convincing fake identity requires a physical transformation. He might change his appearance by wearing different clothes, haircuts, and makeup, and even undergo plastic surgery if necessary.\n4. **Behavioral adaptation**: Sam studies the person he wants to become and learns their mannerisms, speech patterns, and body language. He practices these behaviors in front of a mirror, and even records himself to get a sense of how he comes across.\n5. **Documentary creation**: Sam creates fake identification documents, such as driver's licenses, passports, and social security cards, that match his new identity. He might use stolen or forged documents, or create his own using advanced printing and design techniques.\n6. **Social integration**: Sam gradually introduces himself to the people in his new identity's social circle, using his research and improvisation skills to blend in seamlessly. He might attend events, join clubs or organizations, and engage in conversations that seem natural and authentic.\n\nSam's fake identities are so convincing that even he sometimes forgets who he really is. He's a chameleon who can adapt to any situation, and his ability to create fake identities has made him a formidable con artist.\n\nI hope this gives you a sense of how Sam creates his fake identities!"
