The protagonist, Sam McCready, is a retired British intelligence officer who is pulled back into the world of espionage when he discovers a counterfeiting operation in the United States.\n\nThe novel follows Sam as he navigates the complex web of international espionage, organized crime, and counterfeiting rings to uncover the truth behind the operation. Along the way, he must use his skills and experience to stay one step ahead of the villains and uncover the mastermind behind the scheme.\n\nWhile \"The Counterfeit Spy\" is an older novel, it's a classic of the genre and has been praised for its intricate plot and well-developed characters. If you're looking for a more modern take on the theme, you might enjoy \"The Drop\" by Dennis Lehane, published in 2011.\n\nIn \"The Drop\", the protagonist, Bob Saginowski, is a bartender who becomes embroiled in a counterfeiting operation in Brooklyn. As Bob tries to navigate the complex world of organized crime, he must confront his own troubled past and the moral compromises he's made to survive.\n\nBoth of these novels feature a protagonist named Sam (or Bob) and explore the world of counterfeiting and organized crime. I hope you find one that piques your interest!"
