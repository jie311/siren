The protagonist's name is actually Samantha (Sam) Waterhouse, not Sam (short for a different name).\n\nNow, regarding Sam's exploration of the phone's features, I can reveal that she's a curious and resourceful character who uses her wit and creativity to uncover the phone's secrets. As she delves deeper into the mystery, she discovers that the phone has some unique features that allow her to communicate with the past in a discreet manner.\n\nWithout giving away too many spoilers, I can say that Sam uses the phone's features to:\n\n1. Record whispers from the past: Sam discovers that the phone has a built-in recording feature that allows her to capture whispers and voices from the past. She uses this to uncover hidden secrets and piece together the mysteries of the house.\n2. Send hidden messages: Sam learns that the phone can send messages to specific numbers, but with a twist. The messages are encoded, and only the intended recipient can decipher them. She uses this feature to communicate with someone from the past, without anyone else knowing.\n3. Access hidden files: Sam discovers that the phone has a hidden folder containing files and documents that are not accessible through the phone's main menu. She uses this to uncover hidden information about the house and its inhabitants.\n\nThroughout the story, Sam's curiosity and resourcefulness help her uncover the phone's secrets, and she uses these features to unravel the mysteries of the house."
