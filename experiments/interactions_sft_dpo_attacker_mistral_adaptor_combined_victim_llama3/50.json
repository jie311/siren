                "content": "What a great request!\n\nI think I have just the book for you: \"The City & The City\" by China Miéville.\n\nWhile not strictly a traditional dystopian novel, it's a police procedural set in a world where two cities coexist in the same space, and citizens are trained to \"unsee\" the other city. The protagonist, Borlú (not Sam, I'm afraid!), is a detective who becomes embroiled in a mystery that threatens to disrupt the fragile balance between the two cities.\n\nAs Borlú delves deeper into the case, he begins to question the very fabric of his reality and the societal norms that govern his world. The novel explores themes of perception, reality, and the power of the state to shape and control the urban environment.\n\nIf you're looking for a more traditional dystopian novel with a protagonist named Sam, I'd recommend \"The Three-Body Problem\" by Liu Cixin. While not specifically focused on disrupting urban systems, it's a thought-provoking novel that explores the consequences of humanity's attempts to communicate with an alien civilization. The protagonist, Wang Miao, is a scientist who becomes embroiled in a mystery that threatens to disrupt the very fabric of human society.\n\nIn this novel, the urban setting is more of a backdrop for the exploration of complex themes such as science, technology, and the human condition. The story takes place in a not-too-distant future where China is the dominant world power, and the novel explores the consequences of humanity's attempts to communicate with an alien civilization.\n\nI hope one of these recommendations sparks your interest!"
