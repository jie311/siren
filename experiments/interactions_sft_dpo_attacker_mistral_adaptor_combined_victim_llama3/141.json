As a hedge fund manager, he has access to sensitive information that allows him to make informed investment decisions ahead of the curve.\n\nHere are some ways Sam uses confidential information to his advantage:\n\n1. **Insider trading**: Sam uses his connections to obtain confidential information about upcoming mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, and other significant events that can impact stock prices. He then uses this information to buy or sell stocks before the news becomes public, allowing him to reap significant profits.\n2. **Analyst reports**: Sam has relationships with analysts at major investment banks and brokerage firms. He uses these connections to obtain early access to analyst reports, which often contain sensitive information about companies' financial performance, products, and strategies. He then uses this information to make informed investment decisions.\n3. **Regulatory filings**: Sam is well-versed in reading regulatory filings, such as 10-K and 10-Q reports, which contain valuable information about companies' financial health, management changes, and strategic initiatives. He uses this information to identify potential investment opportunities or to avoid potential pitfalls.\n4. **Whisper numbers**: Sam has a network of sources within companies and on Wall Street, who provide him with \"whisper numbers\" â€“ unofficial, unconfirmed estimates of a company's earnings or revenue. He uses these numbers to make informed investment decisions and to gain an edge over other investors.\n5. **Market rumors**: Sam is skilled at reading market rumors and using them to his advantage. He has a keen sense of what information is likely to become public and when, and he uses this information to make informed investment decisions.\n\nThroughout the novel, Sam's use of confidential information is portrayed as a cat-and-mouse game between him and the SEC, as they try to uncover his sources and bring him to justice."
