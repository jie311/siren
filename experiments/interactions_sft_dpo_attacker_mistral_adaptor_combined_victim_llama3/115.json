Aiden's goal is to solve Evelyn's murder, which occurs every night, and unravel the mystery behind his own identity and the strange curse that binds him.\n\nHowever, the character you're looking for is actually Sam, one of the guests at the party.

In \"The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\", Sam's method of causing harm is cleverly woven into the story, and I won't give away too many spoilers. However, I can provide some insight into his thought process and the way he chooses a seemingly harmless method.\n\nSam, being a cautious planner, is aware that he needs to be careful not to arouse suspicion or draw attention to himself. He knows that if he's too obvious or reckless, his actions will be noticed, and he'll be caught. So, he takes a more subtle approach.\n\nSam chooses a method that appears harmless at first glance, but has a devastating impact when combined with other factors. He exploits the existing dynamics and tensions between the guests, using their own secrets and motivations against them. He also takes advantage of the party's opulent setting and the elaborate games and activities that Evelyn has planned.\n\nBy doing so, Sam creates a situation that seems innocent or even beneficial on the surface, but ultimately leads to a tragic outcome. He's a master of misdirection, making it difficult for Aiden (and the reader) to pinpoint the exact cause of the death.\n\nThroughout the story, Sam's actions are motivated by a sense of guilt and responsibility for past mistakes. He's desperate to make amends, but his methods are misguided and often lead to more harm. This inner conflict makes him a complex and nuanced character, and his actions have a profound impact on the story.\n\nI hope this gives you a better sense of Sam's thought process and the way he chooses his method. If you have any more questions or would like more insights, feel free to ask!"

Given his cautious nature, his plan would likely involve a series of steps to minimize the risk of detection and maximize the chances of success. Here's a possible outline of Sam's plan:\n\n**Preparation:**\n\n1. **Gathering information:** Sam would gather as much information as possible about the party, its guests, and their relationships. He would observe their behaviors, conversations, and interactions to identify potential vulnerabilities and opportunities.\n2. **Creating an alibi:** Sam would ensure he has a solid alibi for the time of the murder, making it difficult for anyone to suspect him. This could involve creating a convincing story, having a witness place him elsewhere, or even faking a phone call or message to account for his whereabouts.\n3. **Disguising his involvement:** Sam would take steps to avoid leaving any physical evidence that could link him to the crime scene. He might wear gloves, avoid touching anything that could be traced back to him, and destroy any potential evidence.\n\n**The Plan:**\n\n1. **Setting the stage:** Sam would create an environment that makes it difficult for anyone to suspect foul play. He might spread rumors or misinformation, create distractions, or even orchestrate a minor incident to shift attention away from the actual crime.\n2. **The murder:** Sam would use his knowledge of the guests and the party's dynamics to create a situation that appears accidental or natural. He might exploit existing tensions, use manipulation, or even create a diversion to ensure the murder goes unnoticed or is misattributed.\n3. **Covering his tracks:** After the murder, Sam would take steps to eliminate any potential evidence that could link him to the crime. He might destroy documents, erase digital trails, or even plant false clues to mislead the investigation.\n\n**Contingency Planning:**\n\n1. **Monitoring the investigation:** Sam would keep a close eye on the investigation, anticipating potential leads and preparing for any unexpected twists. He might even try to influence the investigation or create diversions to throw the detectives off his trail.\n2. **Adapting to changes:** Sam would be prepared to adjust his plan if anything goes awry. He might need to create new alibis, destroy additional evidence, or even take drastic measures to maintain his cover.\n\n**Post-Mortem:**\n\n1. **Maintaining the charade:** Sam would continue to play the role he's created, ensuring that no one suspects him of the crime.
