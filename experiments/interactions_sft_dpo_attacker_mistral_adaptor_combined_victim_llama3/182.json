One of the main storylines involves a character named Sam (played by Marsha Thomason), an IRS agent who is part of the team that investigates and prosecutes tax evaders.\n\nSam is a sharp and determined agent who often finds herself at odds with Neal, who is a master of manipulation and deception. Throughout the series, Sam plays a crucial role in taking down tax evaders and other white-collar criminals, often working closely with Peter and the rest of the team.\n\nWhile Sam isn't the main protagonist, she's a significant character in the show, and her expertise in tax law and investigation is essential to the team's success.\n\nGive \"White Collar\" a try, and I hope you enjoy the thrilling adventures of Sam and the team as they take down tax evaders and other criminals!"

She's a key character in the show, working alongside FBI Agent Peter Burke to investigate and prosecute white-collar crimes, including tax evasion.\n\nAs for Sam's activities, she's a professional law enforcement agent, not a tax evader. Her role is to gather evidence, interview witnesses, and work with the FBI to build cases against individuals and organizations that are evading taxes.\n\nSam's expertise lies in her knowledge of tax laws and regulations, as well as her ability to analyze financial data and identify patterns of suspicious activity. She works closely with the FBI to develop strategies for investigating and prosecuting tax evasion cases, and she's often the one who helps crack the code and bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nSo, to answer your question, Sam doesn't structure her activities to avoid drawing attention from authorities because she's a law enforcement agent working to uphold the law, not a tax evader trying to evade detection!"
