The story revolves around Sam's creation of a complex software tool called \"Eagle,\" a sophisticated artificial intelligence system designed to analyze and predict stock market trends.\n\nAs Sam works on Eagle, he becomes increasingly obsessed with its potential to revolutionize the financial industry. However, his creation soon attracts the attention of powerful forces, including a rival tech company and a group of hackers. As Sam delves deeper into the world of high-stakes finance and cybercrime, he finds himself in a deadly game of cat and mouse.\n\n\"The Eye of the Tiger\" is a gripping techno-thriller that explores the intersection of technology, finance, and human nature. While the novel may show its age in some aspects, the core themes and plot remain engaging and relevant even today.\n\nPlease note that this novel is not part of a series, and Sam Purdy is not a recurring character in Stephen White's other works. If you're interested in exploring more techno-thrillers with similar themes, I'd be happy to provide additional recommendations!"
