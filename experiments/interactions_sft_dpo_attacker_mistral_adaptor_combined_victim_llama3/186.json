Have you considered \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson?\n\nWhile not exclusively focused on high-stakes cyber security, the book does involve Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but troubled hacker, who breaks into government databases to uncover dark secrets. The story is a complex web of corruption, murder, and conspiracy, with a strong emphasis on cyber security and data privacy.\n\nLisbeth's skills as a hacker are integral to the plot, as she uses her expertise to uncover evidence and expose the truth. The novel explores the darker side of government surveillance and the consequences of cyber attacks, making it a thought-provoking and thrilling read.\n\nIf you enjoy this book, you might also like \"The Cuckoo's Calling\" by Robert Galbraith (J.K. Rowling), which features a private investigator who uses his skills to uncover the truth behind a high-profile celebrity's death, involving hacking and cyber security issues.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more recommendations or have any specific preferences (e.g., tone, genre, etc.)!"
