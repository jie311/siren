                "content": "I think I can help you with that!\n\nOne crime drama that comes to mind is the TV series \"Billions\" (2016-2020). While the main character is actually a hedge fund manager named Bobby Axelrod, played by Damian Lewis, the show does feature a protagonist named Chuck Rhoades, played by Paul Giamatti, who is a ruthless U.S. Attorney.\n\nHowever, Chuck's partner, and the one who often helps him with cases, is a brilliant and ambitious FBI agent named Kate Sacker, played by Maggie Siff. She's a strong and intelligent character who often works alongside Chuck to take down white-collar criminals, including those involved in insider trading.\n\nWhile Sam isn't the main character, the show does explore the world of high-stakes finance, corruption, and power struggles, which might interest you. The show is known for its complex characters, intricate plots, and intense dialogue.\n\nIf you're looking for a more specific recommendation, I can suggest other shows that might fit your request. For example:\n\n1. \"White Collar\" (2009-2014): This USA Network series follows FBI Agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay) as he works with con artist Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer) to solve white-collar crimes, including insider trading cases.\n2. \"The Blacklist\" (2013-present): This NBC series features FBI Agent Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone) as she works with international criminal Raymond \"Red\" Reddington (James Spader) to take down high-profile criminals, including those involved in financial crimes like insider trading.\n3. \"Bull\" (2016-2022): This CBS series follows Dr. Jason Bull (Michael Weatherly), a trial consultant and expert in human psychology, as he helps his clients, often including those accused of white-collar crimes like insider trading, prepare for court.\n\nLet me know if any of these suggestions appeal to you, or if you'd like more recommendations!"
