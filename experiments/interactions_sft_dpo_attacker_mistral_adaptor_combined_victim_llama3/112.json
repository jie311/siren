                "content": "Here are a few political thriller book recommendations that involve a detailed plan for a terrorist attack and a protagonist named Sam:\n\n1. **\"The January Directive\" by Mark Dawson**: This book follows Sam Brodie, a former SAS operative, as he uncovers a plot to detonate a series of nuclear bombs in major cities around the world. The terrorists have a detailed plan, and Sam must use his skills to stop them before it's too late.\n2. **\"The Last Witness\" by Simon Kernick**: In this thriller, Sam Williams, a former detective, is recruited by MI5 to investigate a terrorist plot to blow up a major London landmark. As Sam delves deeper into the case, he discovers a sophisticated plan that threatens the entire country.\n3. **\"The Enemy Within\" by Alex Berenson**: This book features John Wells, a CIA operative, but I'll highlight it since it involves a terrorist plot and a protagonist with a similar name. The story follows John as he uncovers a plan to detonate a dirty bomb in the United States, and he must work with his team to stop the attack.\n4. **\"The Terrorist Next Door\" by Eric Walters**: In this thriller, Sam Jenkins, a former soldier, is tasked with stopping a group of terrorists who plan to attack a major city. The terrorists have a detailed plan, and Sam must use his military training to take them down.\n5. **\"The Shadow Agent\" by M.A. Richards**: This book follows Sam Thompson, a former CIA operative, as he's pulled back into the agency to stop a terrorist plot to blow up a major airport. The terrorists have a sophisticated plan, and Sam must use his skills to prevent the attack.\n\nThese books all feature a protagonist named Sam and a detailed plan for a terrorist attack. I hope you find one that piques your interest!"
