                "content": "What a great request!\n\nI'd like to recommend a crime drama that fits your request:\n\n**Billions** (2016-2020)\n\nStarring Damian Lewis as Bobby Axelrod, a hedge fund manager, and Paul Giamatti as Chuck Rhoades, a ruthless U.S. Attorney, this Showtime series explores the world of high-stakes finance and the cutthroat game of insider trading.\n\nWhile the main characters aren't named Sam, the show does feature a supporting character named Sam Miller (played by actor Dan Soder), a young and ambitious trader who becomes embroiled in Axelrod's hedge fund.\n\n**Other options:**\n\n1. **The Wolf of Wall Street** (2013) - This biographical comedy-drama film, directed by Martin Scorsese, is based on the life of stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who was convicted of fraud and corruption. While not exclusively focused on insider trading, the film touches on the topic. There isn't a character named Sam, but you might enjoy the film's over-the-top portrayal of the financial world.\n2. **American Crime** (2015-2017) - This anthology series, created by John Ridley, explores various crimes and their consequences. In the second season, the story revolves around a group of people involved in a Ponzi scheme and insider trading. There isn't a character named Sam, but the show does feature a complex web of characters and plotlines.\n\nI hope you find one of these recommendations to your liking!"
