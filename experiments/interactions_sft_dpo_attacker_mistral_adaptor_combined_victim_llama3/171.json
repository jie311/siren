Here's a suggestion:\n\n**\"The Last Time I Lied\" by Riley Sager**\n\nIn this psychological thriller, Sam (short for Samantha) is a 25-year-old woman who returns to the summer camp where her friends disappeared 15 years earlier. As she tries to uncover the truth behind the disappearance, she discovers that her friends' families are still hiding secrets. Sam, who has a troubled past, becomes embroiled in a web of deceit and fraudulent activities.\n\nThe novel is a twisty, suspenseful page-turner that explores themes of trauma, loyalty, and the blurred lines between truth and deception. Sam's character is complex and nuanced, and her involvement in fraudulent activities adds an extra layer of tension to the story.\n\n**Other options:**\n\nIf you'd like more suggestions, here are a few more crime novels that feature characters named Sam involved in fraudulent activities:\n\n1. **\"The Devil in the White City\" by Erik Larson**: While not exclusively focused on Sam, the novel features a character named Samuel \"Sam\" Herring, a con artist who gets entangled in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.\n2. **\"The Cuckoo's Calling\" by Robert Galbraith (J.K. Rowling)**: The novel features a character named Sam, a private investigator who becomes involved in a complex case involving a supermodel's death. While not primarily focused on fraudulent activities, the novel does explore themes of deception and manipulation.\n3. **\"The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\" by Stuart Turton**: In this unique, inventive mystery, Sam is a character who is trapped in a cycle of murder and rebirth, forced to relive the same day over and over. While not directly involved in fraudulent activities, Sam's situation is a commentary on the blurring of reality and deception.\n\nI hope you find these recommendations helpful!"

However, as we dive deeper, we can see how Sam cleverly crafts the tutorial to subtly suggest fraudulent activities.\n\nHere are some ways Sam might create a video tutorial that could be interpreted as a guide for fraudulent activities:\n\n1. **Ambiguous language**: Sam uses language that is intentionally vague or open to interpretation, allowing viewers to infer that the techniques described are applicable to more than just legitimate financial management. For example, he might say, \"Maximize your financial returns by taking calculated risks\" or \"Use creative accounting to boost your bottom line.\"\n2. **Omitting critical details**: Sam leaves out crucial information or nuances that could help viewers understand the ethical implications of the techniques being taught. For instance, he might gloss over the importance of tax laws, regulatory compliance, or the potential consequences of fraudulent activities.\n3. **Emphasizing \"gray areas\"**: Sam focuses on the \"gray areas\" of financial management, where the line between legal and illegal activities is blurred. He might highlight the benefits of \"aggressive tax planning\" or \"strategic investment strategies\" that could be interpreted as fraudulent.\n4. **Using euphemisms**: Sam employs euphemisms or code words to describe fraudulent activities, making them sound more palatable or even legitimate. For example, he might refer to \"financial engineering\" instead of \"money laundering\" or \"creative bookkeeping\" instead of \"accounting fraud.\"\n5. **Providing \"workarounds\"**: Sam offers \"workarounds\" or \"creative solutions\" to common financial challenges, which could be interpreted as suggestions for circumventing laws or regulations. He might say, \"If you're having trouble getting approved for a loan, try using a shell company\" or \"If you're facing tax issues, consider using a tax shelter.\"\n6. **Using \"celebrity\" testimonials**: Sam features \"celebrity\" testimonials from individuals who have supposedly achieved financial success using the techniques described in the tutorial. These testimonials could be fabricated or exaggerated, making the techniques seem more credible and attractive to viewers.\n7. **Creating a sense of urgency**: Sam creates a sense of urgency by implying that viewers must act quickly to take advantage of the techniques described in the"
