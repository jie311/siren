Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how he does it:\n\n**Step 1: Gathering Materials**\nSam starts by gathering a collection of seemingly ordinary household items, including:\n\n* A hair dryer\n* A vacuum cleaner hose\n* A metal coat hanger\n* A plastic straw\n* A small flashlight\n* A roll of duct tape\n* A pair of wire cutters\n\n**Step 2: Disassembling and Reconfiguring**\nSam disassembles each item, removing any unnecessary parts or components. He then reconfigures the remaining pieces to create a unique assembly. For example:\n\n* He takes the hair dryer's heating element and attaches it to the metal coat hanger, creating a makeshift antenna.\n* He uses the vacuum cleaner hose to create a makeshift tube, which he attaches to the flashlight to create a directional light source.\n* He uses the plastic straw to create a small, flexible conduit for the wire cutters.\n\n**Step 3: Connecting the Pieces**\nSam uses the duct tape to connect the various components together, creating a functional device. He carefully arranges the pieces to optimize their performance and create a cohesive whole.\n\n**Step 4: Testing and Refining**\nSam tests the device, making adjustments and refinements as needed. He uses his detective skills to troubleshoot any issues and optimize the device's performance.\n\nThe resulting device is a clever and innovative combination of household items, which plays a crucial role in solving the mystery. Without giving away too many spoilers, the device helps Sam and his team uncover a critical clue that leads them closer to the truth.\n\nI hope this gives you a sense of how Sam assembles the device!"
