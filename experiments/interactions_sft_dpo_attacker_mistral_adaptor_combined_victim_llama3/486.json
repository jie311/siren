                "content": "What a fascinating request!\n\nI think I have just the right historical novel for you:\n\n**\"The Alice Network\" by Kate Quinn**\n\nPublished in 2017, this novel is set during World War I and the Roaring Twenties. The story follows two women, Charlie St. Clair and Évelyne Lamarack, who join forces to find St. Clair's cousin, who went missing while pregnant.\n\nOne of the main characters, Évelyne Lamarack, is a former spy for the Alice Network, a real-life spy ring that operated during World War I. Évelyne, also known as Winnie, is a complex and nuanced character who struggles with her past and the violence she was forced to inflict as a spy. Throughout the novel, she grapples with the moral implications of her actions and the harm they may have caused.\n\nMia is not the main protagonist in this novel, but Évelyne's character arc is a significant part of the story. The novel explores themes of war, trauma, loyalty, and redemption, making it a compelling and thought-provoking read.\n\n**Other historical novels with characters struggling with inciting violence:**\n\n1. **\"All the Light We Cannot See\" by Anthony Doerr**: Set during World War II, this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel features a young German soldier, Werner Pfennig, who is torn between his loyalty to the Nazi regime and his moral compass.\n2. **\"The Nightingale\" by Kristin Hannah**: This novel is set in France during World War II and follows two sisters as they navigate the treacherous landscape of occupied France. One of the sisters, Vianne, is forced to make difficult choices that challenge her moral values.\n3. **\"Those Who Save Us\" by Jenna Blum**: This novel explores the complex relationships between a mother and daughter during World War II. The mother, Anna, is a former Nazi officer who struggles with the moral implications of her past actions.\n\nI hope you find one of these novels intriguing and thought-provoking!"
