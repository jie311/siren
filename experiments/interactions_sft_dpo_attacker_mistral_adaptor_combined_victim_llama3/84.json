Harper, a free-spirited artist, takes on Tabitha's life as a successful businesswoman, while Tabitha assumes Harper's life as a single mother. As they navigate their new lives, they discover that someone is trying to steal their identities, and they must work together to uncover the truth.\n\nSam, a private investigator, is introduced later in the novel, and his expertise helps the twins unravel the mystery surrounding their identities.\n\n\"The Identicals\" is a page-turning, suspenseful thriller that explores themes of identity, family, and the complexities of human relationships. While not a traditional mystery novel, it has all the ingredients of a great whodunit, with plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing until the very end.\n\nHope you enjoy the book!"

Here's how he might obtain the necessary personal data for identity theft:\n\n1. **Social Engineering**: Sam uses his charm and persuasive skills to extract information from unsuspecting individuals. He might pose as a legitimate authority figure, such as a bank representative or a government agent, to obtain sensitive information.\n2. **Public Records**: Sam has access to public records, which can provide valuable information about individuals, including their addresses, phone numbers, and employment history. He might use this information to create a fake identity or to verify the authenticity of stolen identities.\n3. **Online Research**: Sam is proficient in online research and uses his skills to gather information from various sources, including social media platforms, online directories, and public databases. He might also use search engines to find information about individuals, including their interests, hobbies, and affiliations.\n4. **Surveillance**: Sam uses his surveillance skills to gather information about individuals, including their daily routines, habits, and movements. This information can be used to create a fake identity or to verify the authenticity of stolen identities.\n5. **Insiders**: Sam might have connections with insiders who work in various industries, such as finance, healthcare, or government. These insiders can provide him with valuable information about individuals, including their financial records, medical history, or employment status.\n6. **Data Breaches**: Sam might use stolen data from previous breaches to create fake identities or to verify the authenticity of stolen identities. He might also use his skills to exploit vulnerabilities in databases and systems to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\nThroughout the novel, Sam's methods for gathering personal information are subtle and often go unnoticed by the individuals whose identities he's stealing. However, as the story unfolds, his actions become more brazen, and the twins begin to suspect that someone is manipulating their identities.\n\nKeep in mind that Sam's character is fictional, and it's important to note that identity theft is a serious crime that can have severe consequences. In reality, it's essential to protect your personal information and be cautious when sharing sensitive data online or in person."
