I'd like to suggest a novel that fits your criteria:\n\n**\"The Game of Unraveling\" by Ariadne Bright**\n\nIn this thought-provoking novel, Mia is a brilliant and enigmatic game designer who creates a viral online game called \"The Unraveling\". The game's provocative theme is a simulated \"social experiment\" where players are tasked with navigating a virtual world where moral dilemmas and difficult choices are presented.
