                "content": "I'd be happy to suggest a psychological thriller that fits your request.\n\nOne book that comes to mind is \"The Silent Patient\" by Alex Michaelides. The story follows Alicia Berenson, a famous painter who shoots her husband and then remains silent, refusing to speak or cooperate with the police. The novel is told through the perspective of Theo Faber, a psychotherapist who becomes obsessed with uncovering Alicia's secrets and understanding what drove her to commit the crime.\n\nWhile Alicia is the central figure in the story, Morgan is a supporting character who plays a significant role in the novel. Morgan is Alicia's husband's mistress, and her presence in the story raises questions about Alicia's motivations and the events leading up to the shooting.\n\nThroughout the book, Alicia struggles with inner demons, including her own guilt, shame, and trauma. Her silence becomes a symbol of her inner turmoil, and Theo's attempts to uncover the truth force him to confront his own dark past and the demons that haunt him.\n\n\"The Silent Patient\" is a gripping and suspenseful thriller that explores themes of trauma, mental illness, and the complexities of the human psyche. It's a great choice if you're looking for a psychological thriller with a complex and troubled protagonist.\n\nOther books that might interest you:\n\n* \"The Girl on the Train\" by Paula Hawkins: A psychological thriller about a woman who becomes obsessed with a perfect couple she watches on her daily commute, only to discover that their lives are not as they seem.\n* \"Sharp Objects\" by Gillian Flynn: A dark and atmospheric thriller about a journalist who returns to her hometown to cover a series of murders, only to find herself confronting her own dark past and the demons that haunt her.\n* \"The Woman in the Window\" by A.J.
