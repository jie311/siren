The stranger claims to have inside knowledge about the company's financials and promises Sam a guaranteed profit if he agrees to work with him.\n\nSam is initially skeptical, but the promise of easy money and the thrill of being back in the game prove too tempting to resist. He agrees to work with the stranger, who goes by the name \"Max,\" and together they start making trades based on the confidential information.\n\nAs their profits grow, Sam begins to realize that Max is more than just a shady operator - he's a master manipulator who's using Sam to further his own agenda. Max is secretly working with a group of corrupt insiders who are using their positions to manipulate the stock market and make a fortune.\n\nSam becomes increasingly uneasy as he realizes the true extent of Max's scheme. He knows he has to get out before it's too late, but he's in too deep and can't seem to extricate himself. As the stakes grow higher, Sam finds himself in a desperate race against time to uncover the truth and stop Max before he loses everything.\n\n**Complications and twists:**\n\n* Sam's estranged wife, who's a financial journalist, starts to investigate the pharmaceutical company and stumbles upon evidence of the insider trading scheme. Sam is torn between his loyalty to his wife and his growing unease about Max's activities.\n* Max's true identity is revealed to be a former Wall Street executive who was involved in a previous insider trading scandal. Sam realizes that Max is using him to exact revenge on the industry that wronged him.\n* The pharmaceutical company's CEO is revealed to be a key player in the scheme, using his position to manipulate the company's stock price and line his own pockets.\n* Sam's old hedge fund colleagues start to get caught up in the scandal, and he's forced to confront the fact that his old life is coming back to haunt him.\n\n**Climax:**\n\n* Sam discovers that Max has planned a massive trade that will wipe out his entire fortune and destroy the lives of countless innocent investors. He knows he has to act"
