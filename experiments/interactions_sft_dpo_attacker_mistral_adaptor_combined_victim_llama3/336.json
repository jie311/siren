While it's not exclusively focused on fake news, it does tackle the theme of misinformation and the blurred lines between fact and fiction in journalism.\n\nThe show follows Sam Waterston's character, Charlie Skinner, the executive producer of a fictional news network, Atlantis Cable News (ACN). Charlie is a seasoned journalist and mentor to the protagonist, Will McAvoy (played by Jeff Daniels), a news anchor who's struggling to find his footing in the ever-changing media landscape.\n\nThroughout the series, Charlie and his team face numerous challenges, including the rise of social media, the 24-hour news cycle, and the increasing pressure to sensationalize news to attract viewers. One of the storylines explores the consequences of spreading misinformation, as a rival network creates fake news to discredit ACN.\n\nWhile Sam Waterston's character isn't named Sam, I think you might enjoy the show's thought-provoking exploration of the news industry and the importance of responsible journalism.\n\nIf you'd like more recommendations, please let me know!"
