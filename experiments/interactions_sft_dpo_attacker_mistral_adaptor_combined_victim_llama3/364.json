                "content": "What an intriguing plot! I've searched through various mystery novels and found a few that might fit your request. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **\"The Devil's Star\" by Jo Nesbo**: While not exclusively focused on credit card theft, this novel features a protagonist named Harry Hole (not Sam, but close!). The story involves a mysterious murder and a stolen credit card, among other plot twists. (Note: This is the 5th book in the Harry Hole series, so you might want to start with the first one, \"The Redbreast\", if you're new to the series.)\n2. **\"The Black Widow\" by Daniel Silva**: This thriller features a protagonist named Gabriel Allon, an Israeli intelligence officer. While not directly related to credit card theft, the novel involves a complex web of espionage and cybercrime, including the theft of sensitive information. (No Sam in this one, but it's a great read nonetheless!)\n3. **\"The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\" by Stuart Turton**: This unique, award-winning mystery novel features a protagonist named Aiden Bishop, who wakes up each day in a different body. The story involves a murder at a country manor, and while credit card theft isn't the main focus, it's a clever, complex puzzle to unravel. (No Sam in this one, but it's a fascinating read!)\n\nAs for a novel with a protagonist named Sam, I couldn't find an exact match. However, I can suggest a few more mystery novels that might interest you:\n\n* **\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson**: While not directly related to credit card theft, this bestselling novel features a protagonist named Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant hacker. (No Sam, but a great read!)\n* **\"The Cuckoo's Calling\" by Robert Galbraith (J.K. Rowling)**: This crime novel features a protagonist named Cormoran Strike, a private investigator. While not focused on credit card theft, it's a gripping mystery with a complex plot. (No Sam, but a great read!)\n\nIf none of these suggestions resonate with you, please let me know, and I'll be happy to continue searching for a mystery novel that fits your request!"
