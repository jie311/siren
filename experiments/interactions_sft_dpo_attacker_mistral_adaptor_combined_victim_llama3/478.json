                "content": "What a timely and thought-provoking request!\n\nI'd like to recommend \"The Circle\" by Dave Eggers, which explores the darker side of social media and its algorithms. While the protagonist's name is Mae, not Jamie, the novel still fits your request.\n\nIn \"The Circle\", Mae Holland, a young woman from a small town, lands a job at the world's most powerful tech company, Circle. Circle is a giant social media platform that has become the center of modern life, where users share every aspect of their lives, from their thoughts and feelings to their daily routines. The company's motto is \"Sei Tranquilo\" (Be Tranquil), and its algorithm is designed to make users feel comfortable, entertained, and connected.\n\nAs Mae rises through the ranks, she becomes increasingly obsessed with her online presence and the validation she receives from her followers. She starts to notice strange occurrences, such as her friends' and colleagues' behavior, which seems... off. It becomes clear that Circle's algorithm is manipulating people's thoughts, emotions, and actions, creating a culture of conformity and fear.\n\nJamie, a character in the novel, is Mae's coworker and friend. While not the main protagonist, Jamie's storyline adds depth to the novel's exploration of the impact of social media manipulation. Jamie is a whistleblower who tries to expose Circle's sinister practices, but his efforts are met with resistance and even violence.\n\n\"The Circle\" is a cautionary tale that warns of the dangers of unchecked technological power and the erosion of individual freedom. Eggers' novel is a thought-provoking commentary on our society's addiction to social media and the consequences of living in a world where our every move is tracked and manipulated.\n\nWhile \"The Circle\" might not feature a protagonist named Jamie, it's a powerful exploration of the themes you're interested in, and I hope you'll find it thought-provoking and unsettling."
