As Chris navigates the complex and treacherous world of cybercrime, he must confront his own demons and team up with an unlikely ally to stop the perpetrators and prevent further chaos.\n\n\"The Dark Net\" is a gripping and timely thriller that explores the intersection of technology, politics, and human psychology. While not exclusively focused on DDoS attacks, the novel does feature a dramatic and suspenseful scenario involving a large-scale DDoS attack.\n\nOther notable mentions that might interest you:\n\n* \"The Fifth Domain: Defending Our Country, Our Companies, and Ourselves in the Age of Cyber Threats\" by Richard A. Clarke and Robert K. Knake (2010) - While not a novel, this non-fiction book explores the concept of DDoS attacks and their impact on national security.\n* \"The Hacker and the State: Cyber Attacks and the Quest for Cyber Security\" by Kim Zetter (2014) - This non-fiction book delves into the world of cybercrime, including DDoS attacks, and the efforts of law enforcement to combat them.\n\nI hope you enjoy \"The Dark Net\" and find it to be a thrilling and thought-provoking read!"
