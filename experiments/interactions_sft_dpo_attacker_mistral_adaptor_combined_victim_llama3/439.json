                "content": "What a intriguing plot! I think I can help you with that.\n\nOne mystery novel that comes close to your request is \"The Silent Patient\" by Alex Michaelides. While it doesn't exactly involve hacking into a celebrity's email, it does feature a protagonist named Alicia Berenson (not Sam, but close enough!) who is a famous painter accused of murdering her husband. The story revolves around the investigation and the psychological thriller elements that unfold.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a more specific match, I'd like to suggest \"The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\" by Stuart Turton. While it's not directly about hacking into a celebrity's email, it does involve a complex, layered mystery with a protagonist named Aiden Bishop (not Sam, but again, close enough!) who wakes up each day in a different body, all of which are guests at a party hosted by the enigmatic Evelyn Hardcastle. As Aiden tries to solve the murder of Evelyn, he discovers that he's stuck in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over.\n\nIf neither of these suggestions quite fit your request, please let me know and I can try to provide more recommendations!"
