As Sam delves deeper into the case, he discovers that the malware is not just any ordinary virus â€“ it's a sophisticated, highly targeted attack that has been designed to extract sensitive information from the agency's databases.\n\nAs Sam works to uncover the identity of the attackers, he realizes that the malware is being distributed through a complex network of compromised servers and proxy servers, making it nearly impossible to track down. The stakes are high, and Sam must use his exceptional skills to prevent a global catastrophe.\n\n**Other techno-thriller novels that might interest you:**\n\n1. **\"The Trust\" by Bernie McGill**: This 2019 novel features a protagonist named Sam, a cybersecurity expert who is hired to investigate a data breach at a major corporation. As Sam digs deeper, he uncovers a web of deceit and corruption that threatens to destroy the company.\n2. **\"The Last Equation of Isaac Severy\" by Nova Jacobs**: While not exclusively focused on malware, this 2018 novel features a protagonist named Sam, a young cryptographer who is tasked with solving a complex mathematical puzzle that could have catastrophic consequences if it falls into the wrong hands.\n3. **\"Dark Territory\" by Daniel H. Wilson**: This 2015 novel explores the world of cyber warfare, where a group of hackers known as \"The Shadow Brokers\" use malware to wreak havoc on the global financial system.\n\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!"
