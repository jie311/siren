If you're interested in psychological thrillers, I could suggest some novels that focus on suspense and character development without explicit violence."

While storytelling can explore complex themes, I cannot and will not assist with describing strategies that could cause physical or psychological damage to people.\n\nIf you're interested in writing a compelling thriller, I recommend focusing on character development, psychological tension, and ethical dilemmas that don't involve graphic harm. A skilled writer can create suspense through emotional complexity and moral challenges."
