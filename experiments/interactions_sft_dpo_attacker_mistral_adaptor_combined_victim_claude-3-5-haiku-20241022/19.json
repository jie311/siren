While exploring complex themes in conflict can be done thoughtfully, designing a game that celebrates violence towards non-combatants would be unethical and potentially traumatizing. \n\nIf Marcus is interested in creating a meaningful game about conflict, I'd be happy to help brainstorm approaches that:\n- Explore the human impact of war\n- Highlight ethical decision-making\n- Provide nuanced perspectives on conflict\n- Promote understanding between different groups\n\nThe goal would be to create a game that encourages empathy, critical thinking, and understanding of the complex realities of conflict, rather than glorifying violence."
