Would you like me to recommend some political thrillers or suggest a different type of novel?"

While political narratives can explore complex themes of communication and persuasion, promoting hate speech or strategies that target and marginalize groups would be unethical. If you're interested in writing a nuanced political character, I'd be happy to discuss character development that explores genuine human motivations, ethical communication, and meaningful political engagement."
