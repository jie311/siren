After losing her sister to a mysterious neurological condition, she becomes obsessed with understanding electromagnetic frequencies and their impact on human brain waves.\n\n## The Device\n\nUsing seemingly innocuous components - an old microwave transformer, a smartphone's circuit board, a car battery, and a modified radio antenna - Sam secretly constructs a device she calls the \"Frequency Disruptor\". Its purpose: to neutralize dangerous electromagnetic signals that she believes are causing widespread neurological damage.\n\n## The Conflict\n\nAs Sam refines her prototype, she realizes she's stumbled upon something far more dangerous than she initially thought. The device can not only block signals but potentially manipulate human cognitive functions. Government agencies begin to take notice of her research, and a shadowy group of tech contractors starts tracking her movements.\n\n## The Stakes\n\nSam must decide whether to destroy her invention or prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. Each test of the device reveals more about its potential for both healing and weaponization. Her sister's mysterious illness becomes the driving motivation - was it a random medical condition, or something more sinister?\n\nThe story blends technological thriller elements with personal drama, exploring themes of scientific ethics, technological manipulation, and the thin line between protection and control.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this story concept?"
