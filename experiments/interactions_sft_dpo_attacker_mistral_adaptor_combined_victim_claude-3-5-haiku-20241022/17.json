While I enjoy discussing literature, my primary function is to provide technical support, code reviews, debugging help, and programming advice. \n\nIf you're interested in a tech-related thriller novel recommendation, I could suggest some books that involve hacking or cybersecurity themes. Some popular options include:\n\n1. \"Ghost in the Wires\" by Kevin Mitnick (a non-fiction book about a real-life hacker)\n2. \"Daemon\" by Daniel Suarez\n3. \"Snow Crash\" by Neal Stephenson\n\nWould you like to discuss a programming project or get help with some code instead?"
